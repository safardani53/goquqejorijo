She is featured wearing white silk <strong>Calvin Klein</strong> dresses and stunning jewelry. It was her sheer black <strong>Gucci</strong> Spring/Summer 16 dress that really stole the show, though. The dress was completely see-through and was dotted with little black sequins, while the back featured such a cool red and white snake pattern across her back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In true Emily style, she went completely braless under the frock and showed off extreme sideboob. She is totally not afraid to show some skin and she is always flaunting her breasts in any way she can — good for her! We love Emily because she doesn’t care what anyone thinks and just does what she wants. She loves to flaunt her body and she has no shame — it’s amazing!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>She dished to the mag about why she’s comfortable in her own skin, “My mum said ‘no, she’ll be a brain surgeon,’ because she didn’t like the idea that I would think that [my appearance] was the only thing that I was going to be valued for. She always told me never to feel sorry or apologetic or embarrassed by my body, to never apologise for my sexuality.” Wow, how amazing is that?!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>What do you guys think of Emily’s sexy new photoshoot — doesn’t she look amazing?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH12e5ByZp6lmaHGbr7ArZijo5%2BswKy1jKygnZ2SpLyjedKhnJ6qXZe5oq%2FKZpurnaOoeqO%2BwKWcrKtdmsBuucCgmLOhnpp6sbXCrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allen-mcneill.html><span>←</span><span>Allen McNeill</span></a>
