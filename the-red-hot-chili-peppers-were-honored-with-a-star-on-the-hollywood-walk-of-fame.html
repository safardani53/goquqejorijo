During the band’s induction ceremony, celebrities such as Woody Harrelson, George Clinton, and Bob Forrest were in attendance. They delivered remarks as the Red Hot Chili Peppers were honored with the 2,717th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>Anthony Kiedis, the band’s frontman, told reporters:</p><p>“This is not a narrative about people, in my opinion.” Chad, Flea, and John are all people I adore. They have incredible talent. When we join together, something far bigger than the sum of our parts occurs. We were able to discover something we like doing and connect with the rest of the world as a result of the sum of our parts.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-2.jpg alt="Red Hot Chili Peppers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“We began by playing dive bars up and down this street and making a few people dance.&nbsp;We worked hard as a team and as a band, and now we can make everyone dance and feel happy.”</p><h2>Unlimited Love is the 12th studio album by Red Hot Chili Peppers.</h2><p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Walk of Fame the day before their album, Unlimited Love, was released. It is the band’s 12th studio album, and it was released on April 1, 2022, by Warner Records.&nbsp;Rick Rubin, who previously worked with the band in the late ’90s and early ’00s, produced the album. It also reintroduces the band’s guitarist John Frusciante, who departed in 2009 and returned in 2019 to replace Josh Klinghoffer. Anthony Kiedis (lead vocals), Flea (bass), Chad Smith (drummer), and John Frusciante currently make up the band (guitarist).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Red-Hot-Chili-Peppers-3.jpg alt="Red Hot Chili Peppers" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>The band’s debut song, Black Summer, was released in February of this year and achieved the Chili Peppers’ fourteenth number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs list.
