The Disney actor died in July 2019 <a href=#>after suffering an epileptic seizure</a> in his sleep. He was 20 years old.</p><p>“It is <a href=#>with a profoundly heavy heart</a> that we report that this morning we lost Cameron,” a spokesperson for the Jessie alum’s family told Us Weekly at the time. “He passed away in his sleep due to a seizure which was a result of an ongoing medical condition for which he was being treated. The world is now undoubtedly without one of its brightest lights, but his spirit will live on through the kindness and compassion of all who knew and loved him.”</p><p>The statement continued: “We are utterly heartbroken and ask for privacy during this immensely difficult time as we grieve the loss of our precious son and brother.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/How-Adam-Sandler-Honors-Late-Cameron-Boyce-New-Movie-Hubie-Halloween-01.jpg><p>Shortly after news broke of Boyce’s death, the <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum issued a powerful message of support for the California native’s loved ones. “Too young. Too sweet. Too funny. Just the nicest, more talented, and most decent kid around,” Sandler tweeted in July 2019. “Loved that kid. Cared so much about his family. Cared so much about the world. Thank you, Cameron, for all you gave us. So much more was on the way. All our hearts are broken. <a href=#>Thinking of your amazing family</a> and sending our deepest condolences.”</p><p>As they continue to mourn, the Descendants actor’s family and former colleagues are <a href=#>working hard to preserve his legacy</a> through the Cameron Boyce Foundation, which seeks to educate young people about epilepsy and advocate for other issues that Boyce held close to his heart. In May 2020, on what would have been the actor’s 21st birthday, <a href=#>fans raised nearly $50,000</a> for the organization in his honor.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, Boyce’s former Jessie costar<a href=#> <strong>Skai Jackson</strong></a> dedicated her performance to her late friend on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> with partner <a href=#><strong>Alan Bersten</strong></a>.</p><p>“We just really <a href=#>built this bond for years and years and years</a> and he was kind of like a big brother figure to me, you know, and always looked out for me through everything,” the 18-year-old recalled. “He really molded me into the person I am now. Of course, I miss him every day. … It just makes me a little bit sad, of course. He’s not here, but I know that he would be really proud of me. … I’m just really glad that he’s here to watch over us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJidmZ1iwKK6w6Wcq2Wglsa0edOroJutpJp6tbuMpZitnV2Yrq6x0ailZpqfrrCmecinZKGtkp6ybrTApaOor5Wau3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fans-dub-cheryl-ladds-dancing-with-the-stars-elimination-a-set-up.html><span>←</span><span> Fans dub Cheryl Ladds Dancing With the Stars elimination a set up Wed 5 October 2022 1</span></a>
