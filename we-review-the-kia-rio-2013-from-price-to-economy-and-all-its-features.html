KIA&nbsp;have been cashing 9in on the value-for-money market for a number of years.
The style input from Peter Schreyer has meant they have a tasty range to choose from.
But the real feast is that you get a lot of car for your money — and the running bills don't keep draining your wallet."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It has become a classy hatch that is an ideal first or second buy. Jamie and Christie are more about looks and power. Jamie liked the power the £13,595 1.4 diesel offered.</p><p>He was impressed with how easily you can feed the power on, even though the&nbsp;Rio&nbsp;took 13.7 seconds to do 0-60mph and topped out at 107mph. Christie liked the looks — the&nbsp;Rio&nbsp;is longer, lower and better equipped than before.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More Motors</h2></p><p>That means plenty of room for passengers and a chance for her to fill the boot with shopping.</p><p>For Sheila and me, the 70mpg was a godsend and it is well put together.</p><p>That is great news when you have a marauding, and growing, puppy. Alfie is almost full size now and that means he takes up a fair amount of room. But, in his puppy state, he still likes to chew things. Thankfully, the&nbsp;Rio&nbsp;is robust enough to cope.</p><p>It is also fun to drive. It is a supermini that likes to be revved, hugs the corners and is very stable even over the potholes.</p><p>You could do far worse than putting one on your options list when you are looking for a teenager's first motor.</p><p>Kia&nbsp;Rio&nbsp;1.4d ISG 2 What will it cost me? £13,595 Engine: 1.4litre diesel ISG.
