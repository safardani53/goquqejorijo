It focuses on the key events that led up to the incident and displays conversations with different persons who express their perspectives on the occurrence.</p><p>Andrew Callaghan goes throughout the nation with a microphone, interviewing different individuals in an attempt to get a comprehensive understanding of the country’s attitude and what led to the Capitol incident.
