It seems like it’d be a very easy sort of play that I could make. So, it’s a chess move, but I don’t know what’s at stake yet.”</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Olivieri added that for her, the perfect ending for her character would involve “sitting on the balcony of the Dutton Ranch, drinking Beth’s drink.” When asked if she’d want Sarah to have Jamie by her side, the Rosewood alum jokingly replied, “Who cares!”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p>When <a href=#>the first half of season 5 wrapped up</a> in January, Sarah’s motivations remained murky, but it’s clear that she has it out for Beth. Beth, meanwhile, told her father, John Dutton (<a href=#><strong>Kevin Costner</strong></a>), that she thinks they should kill Jamie. At the end of the midseason finale, Jamie then told Sarah that he wants to murder Beth.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While the strength of Sarah and Jamie’s bond is still up in the air, the connection between Olivieri and Bentley, 44, as scene partners couldn’t be better — which admittedly came as a “surprise” for the Secrets and&nbsp;Lies&nbsp;star.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I was walking into that job thinking I was gonna work opposite of a very victim-y, smarmy, kind of weak energy [character].&nbsp;And Wes himself is very dynamic, very smart, very sensitive and there’s something very powerful inside of him,” she told Us. “And I love taking [the] potential of that energy and fluffing it, heating it up, because I can grow that kind of thing. If it’s in there, I can make it bigger and I can do that with men.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Olivieri explained that as an actress, she’s able to “build confidence in things,” something that was “called for” when stepping into the role of Sarah — both on screen and off.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I talked to <strong>Taylor [Sheridan]</strong> about it. And I was like, ‘How did you know that that was part of it?’” she recalled. “Like, you wouldn’t know that that’s why I was cast, or that that was the role of Sarah and Dawn to do that to Jamie and Wes. But that’s what ended up happening.&nbsp;[Wes is]&nbsp;growing in power as a human and as an actor, as a character. It’s all happening simultaneously.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The second half of season 5 doesn’t yet have a premiere date, but it’s clear that the war between Jamie and Beth is only just starting. The new episodes were set to air this summer, but Yellowstone star <a href=#><strong>Wendy Moniz</strong></a> confirmed at PaleyFest that filming hasn’t yet begun.</p><p>“We know [co-creator Sheridan] is writing and we’re looking forward to getting back,” the <a href=#>House of Cards</a> alum, 54, told Us. “I’m along for this ride for as long as it goes. That’s what I can tell you. It’s just been a dream job.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Mo Brings Plenty</strong></a>, who plays the right-hand man of Thomas Rainwater (<strong>Gil Birmingham</strong>), assured fans that <a href=#>they shouldn’t be worried about what’s coming</a>. “Honestly, it’s Taylor Sheridan,” the Hell on Wheels veteran, 53, told Us. “Be prepared for something exciting and a wild ride.”</p><p>With reporting by Stephanie Webber</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaLCepJykxLTAzqecrGWUlsSvec6loK%2Bhlae2brDErZiipKNiwKK%2BwKGqZqiclru0ecWoqWaikaK2pns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-eric-faulkner-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Eric Faulkner Dating Now</span></a>
