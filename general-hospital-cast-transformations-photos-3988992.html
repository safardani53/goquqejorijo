Meanwhile, soap opera fans were already familiar with Laura from her time on&nbsp;The City and Guiding Light when she came to&nbsp;General Hospital. She was already a full-fledged adult when she debuted on&nbsp;GH, but she’s gotten even more glam and gorgeous over the years!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Kelly Monaco</strong> started out on&nbsp;General Hospital in 2003. She stars as Sam McCall on the show. She was 27 years old at the time, and is now in her mid-40s.
