Though old school, holiday cards have always been a great way let people connect with family and friends wide and far. A photo and a little life update is all you really need to make grandma or that great-aunt happy! And nowadays with social media, you can even spare the stamps and post that family <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas</a> message directly to the web instead of via a postcard or letter.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Just like us, celebs totally love the annual Christmas card tradition. Stars adore sharing with their fans, and how can they pass up a festive opportunity to get glammed up with the fam? Even royal family members,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a>, have gotten in on the fun with a 2022 Christmas card.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>And while the holidays are all about harmony, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas cards</a> can still contain a little family drama. Who’s in the portrait and who skipped the photo session are often the topics of discussion. (With that in mind, we’re definitely keeping an eye out for the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kardashian Christmas card</a> this year.) Want to see 2022’s best celebrity Christmas cards? Check out everyone from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>VP Kamala Harris</strong></a> right here.</p><h2>Kate Middleton & Prince William</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/royal-christmas-card-2022-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Kate and William shared their Christmas card with fans via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a> on Dec. 13. This year, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family card</a> features the loving couple along with their three children:&nbsp;<strong>Prince George, Princess Charlotte</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Prince Louis</strong>. Charlotte stands in the middle of the family portrait, holding her brothers’ hands. Meanwhile, George, who is looking quite tall these days, holds tight to Prince William, while Louis grips his mom’s hand for the shot. The family is dressed quite casually for the gorgeous holiday image.</p><h2>Chrissy Teigen & John Legend</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a> was all about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas camp</a> in her and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>John Legend’s</strong></a> family holiday card this year. The cookbook author bared her baby bump wearing an ugly, unbuttoned <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christmas sweater</a> and red leggings in the photo, which was taken at their annual holiday party and shared on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The star’s hair and makeup was totally wacky, teaming a retro bob with blue eyeshadow and red lips. John was super handsome as he sat on a velvet throne with kids <strong>Luna</strong> and <strong>Miles.</strong> His green sweater made him look like a fully decorated Christmas tree while the kids were cute in red and black.</p><h2>King Charles & Queen Consort Camila</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/king-charles-camilla-christmas-card-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>King Charles III&nbsp;</strong></a>and his wife, Queen Consort&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Camilla Parker-Bowles</strong></a>, released their first-ever Christmas Card as a monarch in a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>regal portrait</a> published Dec. 11. The photo was taken at the Braemar Royal Highland Gathering on Sept. 3, just a few days before the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>death of his mother</a><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Queen Elizabeth</strong></a> at the age of 96 on Sept. 8, 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year,” a message inside the card, placed in front of a Christmas Tree at London’s Clarence House, read in red font. The card was also released on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Royal Family’s Instagram account</a> along with a message reading, “We’re pleased to share this year’s Christmas Card from The King and The Queen Consort.”</p><h2>Prince Harry & Meghan Markle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/meghan-markle-prince-harry-christmas-card-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Prince Harry&nbsp;</b></a>and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><b>Meghan Markle</b></a> sent out their annual holiday card on Dec. 16, a day after the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>second installment</a>&nbsp;of their hit Netflix documentary&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harry & Meghan</a> dropped. The sweet greeting, which you can see <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>, featured a gorgeous black and white photo of the couple from their appearance at the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights awards earlier this month. Emblazoned at the top of the virtual card&nbsp;are the words: “Wishing you a joyful holiday season.”</p><h2>Hilary Duff</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Things looked like pure chaos in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a> and husband <strong>Matthew Koma’s&nbsp;</strong>family Christmas card, which they shared on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. In the snap, the parents were tied to chairs with lights while the Lizzie McGuire star’s three kids <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Luca</a></strong>, 10, <strong>Banks</strong>, 4, and <strong>Mae</strong>, 1, took charge. While big brother Luca wrapped lights around the parents, his little sisters indulged in sweets.</p><h2>Ozzy & Kelly Osbourne</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong></a> showed off his Scrouge-y side in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his holiday card</a>, which showed daughter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly Osbourne</strong></a> in her first snap since welcoming a baby. Also joined by guitarist <strong>Billy Morrison</strong>, the trio gave up some serious frowns in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. Continuing that energy, the rocker wrote, “Bah, Humbug!” in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Each was clad in their own cool Christmas sweater. While the Osbournes rocked Ozzy/Grinch-inspired attire, Billy was in a <i>Gremlins-themed</i>&nbsp;knit.</p><h2>Tori Spelling</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a>, 49, was all about togetherness in her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>annual Xmas card</a>. While husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dean McDermott</strong></a>, 56, was noticeably absent from the 2021 greeting, he was right along with his wife and their gaggle of kiddos this year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>The family certainly looked like a big happy group in the photo. Tori and gang gathered&nbsp; outdoors while dresses in their best sparkles. She and Dean were surrounded by their children <strong>Liam,</strong> 15, <strong>Stella,</strong> 14, <strong>Hattie,</strong> 11, <strong>Finn,</strong> 10, and <strong>Beau,</strong> 5, all of whom coordinated with matching looks. Dean’s son <strong>Jack McDermott</strong>, 24, whom he shares with ex-wife <strong>Mary Jo Eustace</strong>, also appeared in the pic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>“It’s my favorite time of year!” Tori gushed in her caption, which also gave a shout-out to printer <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>SimplytoImpress.com</a>. The New York Times bestselling author went on, telling fans, “This year is extra special. We’re ALL together!”</p><h2>Kris Jenner</h2><p id=content-paragraph-26>Christmas 2022 was special for Kris Jenner, 67, and her main man, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Corey Gamble</strong></a>, 42. They took their very first couple’s card, in partnership with Shutterfly, and boy did they look snazzy. Corey was handsome in a teal cableknit sweater and velour pants while the momager-in-chief looked like a boss wearing a red and white plaid jacket with tall boots and grey jeans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>Kris was all about the card with her beau of 8 years. “You guys know I LIVE for the holidays!” she remined fans in her caption “This year, @coreygamble and I made our first-ever holiday card together with @Shutterfly and we love how they came out.” The star went on, “We can’t wait to send them to family and friends and celebrate the season!” and signed off with a cheery,&nbsp; “Happy Holidays!”</p><h2>The Today Show</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wishing you a happy holiday season from the TODAY family! 🌟 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/uPj1iBgSHn</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-28>— TODAY (@TODAYshow) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 5, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-30>Today’s team of anchors had a great time throwing togethering their “Happy Holidays” message, shared on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. They took inspiration from the 2003 Christmas classic Love Actually in a clip that featured <strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong>, <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong>, <strong>Craig Melvin</strong>, <strong>Dylan Dreyer</strong>, <strong>Carson Daly</strong>, <strong>Sheinelle Jones</strong>, <strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong>, <strong>Willie Geist</strong>, and the rest of Studio 1A showing off giant handwritten cards, a lá <strong>Andrew Lincoln’s</strong> character from the film.</p><p id=content-paragraph-31>Their collective message said, “The holidays are here/ and so are we / bringing good cheer. Wishing you peace / and joy / love / and laughter / to last the whole year. Thank you / for waking up with us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-32>Sadly, longtime co-anchor <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Al Roker</strong></a> wasn’t able to make it for the video. But the team found a cute way to include him. Hoda, Savannah, and Craig held up cutouts of the veteran weatherman, which they carried with love.</p><h2>Vice President Kamala Harris</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>‘Tis the season! We invited students from across Washington, D.C. to make ornaments and celebrate the holidays with us. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/MP1NgvDTc4</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-33>— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>December 9, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-35>Vice President Harris and Second Husband <strong>Doug Emhoff</strong> gave one young artist the opportunity of a lifetime with their 2022 holiday card. When 10th grader <strong>Alex Berko</strong>, 15, was tasked to illustrate a wintery rendition of the Second Family’s home at the Naval Observatory, he had no idea his design was competing to be the VP’s annual Christmas card. He was announced as the winner in Nov. and visited the family for the holidays on Dec. 5, 2022, as reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-36>The fun didn’t stop there for the VP!
