Shortly after their split in 2006, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Blue Bloods</a> star revealed that she had gotten pregnant before they broke up. The co-parents welcomed their son, John "Jack" Edward Thomas Moynahan, on Aug. 22, 2007, in Santa Monica, California.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Brady was nervous about the "challenge" of fatherhood prior to Jack's birth, he's embraced the role wholeheartedly over the years. Brady lived in Massachusetts when he played for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>New England Patriots</a> but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>moved to Florida</a> after joining the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

In 2018, the former <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Victoria's Secret Angel</a> told PEOPLE that she had already begun dating Brady when Moynahan realized she was pregnant, which "wasn't the ideal situation" for them. "But <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>I'm so grateful</a> for [Bridget]," she added. "I know this was hard, but I couldn't imagine my life without [Jack].
