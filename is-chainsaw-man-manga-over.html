After being killed by the yakuza, Pochita sacrifices his body so that Denji may live. The process grants Denji the ability to become a monster with chainsaws on his head and arms. He is soon recruited by the Public Safety Division and continues to kill devils for an honest living.</p><p>The future holds even more chainsaw action, in both anime and manga form.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is the 'Chainsaw Man' manga over?</h2><p>Written by Tatsuki Fujimoto, the original manga began in 2018 on the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine in Japan. Throughout its run, the series received several nominations and awards for achievements in art and manga publication. In 2021, the series won at the illustrious Shogakukan Manga Awards for Best Shōnen Manga. The final chapter was published in December 2020, but it included a very enticing teaser at the end.</p><p>Chapter 97 sees Denji at the end of a long and tragic battle. After losing many of his friends in the Public Safety Division in the battle against its captain Makima, he emerges victorious and takes time to recover from the heavy losses. After a while, he decides to enroll in high school and pursue a formal education but still fights against devils with his identity known to the public.</p><p>The final chapter ends with a panel stating "Part 1: Public Safety Chapter End".</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Of course, that can only mean that even after all of the intense battles and tragic deaths, Chainsaw Man will still continue.
