Sadly, that is not the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The clerk, though very nice, has no actual power in this area, and has to tell the two of them "no."</p><p>Armando and Kenneth are obviously upset but keep their emotions in check.</p><p>She walks them through the paradoxical reasons for which she has no deny them today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"In this case, we have a law that states, ‘No you, can’t,’" the clerk explains.</p><p>"And we have a constitution that says, ‘Yes, you can,’" she continues.</p><p>"Sadly, we don’t have legislation that supports us to reform our code," she laments. "The one that says we still can’t allow same-sex marriage to go through."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That said, the clerk is very much on their side, and recommends that they go to the Human Rights Commission and lodge a complaint.</p><p>This, she says, will hopefully put them on the path to obtaining their marriage license.</p><p>Kenneth and Armando are determined to make their marriage official … but they cannot help but wonder what other surprises are before them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I don’t think even seven words were spoken and it was ‘denied,’" Kenneth laments.</p><p>He continues: "It wasn’t even a discussion. That’s their protocol — to deny you right away."</p><p>An immediate denial is more than some people can handle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In a way, this is a lot like voter suppression.</p><p>Make more requirements and make it harder, and fewer people will do it, even if it’s still possible.</p><p>But as we noted, Kenneth and Armando have anxieties about what will come in the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>For example, Kenneth asks if they will encounter similar roadblocks when they look for a venue.</p><p>The answer is … maybe. Some wedding venues may have bigoted owners. If it’s legal to discriminate, someone will.</p><p>But many wedding venues wouldn’t bat an eye, might consider a gay couple on reality TV to be good publicity, and will never turn down a check.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It may be that Kenneth and Armando knew that this was likely and are doing this battle on camera to highlight this particular injustice.</p><p>If not, they may have other options. There are extremely gay-friendly places in Mexico where they could have a wedding and then return home, still married.</p><p>But if their goal is to show people how many unique obstacles the LGBTQ+ community faces, well, then they’re doing a great job of that. This is so unfair.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8rLHNp5ytoF2jtqawxKuknqGVp3qiusNmmKulkaOxsHnRrpmip12Zsq%2B1xJ1kppmip7ais8Rmo6KblaPApnnOp2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./constance-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Constance Jones Biography</span></a>
