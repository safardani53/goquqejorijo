More than 32,000 people signed a petition calling on the museum to change its mind.</p><h2>What has replaced Dippy?</h2><p>Dippy has been replaced by the giant skeleton of a blue whale, called Hope.</p><p>It has been suspended in a diving pose from the ceiling of the Hintze Hall.</p><p>The near-4.5-tonne whale specimen is more than 100 years old and has been given the name&nbsp;as a "symbol of humanity's power to shape a sustainable future".</p><p>The Natural History Museum acquired the skeleton after it opened in 1881 when it beached in Wexford in Ireland.</p><p>Curators paid Â£250 for the carcass and nearly every bone has been carefully prepared for the skeleton to take centre stage at the museum's entrance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nintchdbpict000338409143.jpg><h2>Will&nbsp;Dippy go back to the Natural History Museum?</h2><p>He will return to the museum, with plans to re-cast the dinosaur in bronze and place him in the gardens that surround the building.</p><p>Museum director Sir Michael Dixon said: "We wanted Dippy to visit unusual locations so he can draw in people that may not traditionally visit a museum.</p><p>"Making iconic items accessible to as many people as possible is at the heart of what museums give to the nation, so we have ensured that Dippy will still be free to view at all tour venues."</p><h2>Where is the first stop on Dippy's tour?</h2><p>The dinosaur will kick off his&nbsp;national tour at Dorset County Museum, which has a gallery dedicated to Britain's fossil-rich Jurassic Coast.</p><p>He appeared 130 miles away at the museum on February 9 and will spend at least four to six months at the museum before moving on to his next home.</p><p>Dr Jon Murden, director of the Dorset County Museum, said he was "excited" at the prospect of Dippy's visit.</p><p>He added: "As the birthplace of palaeontology, there is nowhere in the UK more appropriate for Dippy to start the tour than Dorset, and we're thrilled to have been chosen as the first host venue."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/capture18.png><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Where can you see the famous Diplodocus on tour?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>DIPPY will visit Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and five regions across England.</p><p>The skeleton will be on show at the following venues:</p><ul><li>Dorset County Museum, February - May 2018</li><li>Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, May - September 2018</li><li>Ulster Museum, September 2018 - January 2019</li><li>Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow, January - May 2019</li><li>Great North Museum: Hancock, Newcastle upon Tyne, May - October 2019</li><li>National Assembly for Wales, October 2019 - January 2020</li><li>Number One Riverside, Rochdale, February - June 2020</li><li>Norwich Cathedral, July - October 2020</li></ul><h2>Where's next on Dippy's tour?</h2><p>In chronological order, Dippy will then travel to Birmingham Museum; Ulster Museum; Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow; Great North Museum, Newcastle; the National Assembly of Wales; Number One Riverside, Rochdale; and Norwich Cathedral.</p><p>The venues were chosen from an application list of 90 candidates when plans for the tour were announced last year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Dippy will spend at least four to six months at each location because he will have to be taken apart and reconstructed at every stop on the tour.</p><p>A total of &nbsp;five million people are expected to see him.</p><p>Foundation director Philippa Charles said: "Generations of children have been awestruck by Dippy's spectacular presence at the heart of the Natural History Museum and we hope he continues to inspire the nation to rediscover nature as he works his way around the UK."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Timelapse video of Dippy the Dinosaur deconstruction at Natural History Museum</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ355g5RvaGicmaW9unnToZxmnJmlubCwzpysrGWloHq1u9SrZKudoKGupLHMnqWtZZ6Wwba%2BwKVkoaGjqbyzxYymrKydpaJ8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./valentina-labriolas-boyfriend-list.html><span>â</span><span>Valentina Labriolas Boyfriend: Who is Valentina Labriola Dating?</span></a>
