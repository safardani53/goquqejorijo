So, where are we at with <a href=#>JoJo and Noelle's surgeries</a>?

Jazz stepped up to talk to JoJo's mom and reluctant grandmother about the breast augmentation top surgery that Jojo wanted to pursue.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Saying that her gender dysphoria "has been pretty bad," JoJo candidly shared that "taking the hormones has not worked in the way that I would have liked it to, like, my chest isn't where it's supposed to be."&nbsp;</p><p>"It's gotten to the point where I don't want to go to work, I don't want to get out of bed, I don't want to do anything," she continued. "I just want to stay in bed and wait until I blossom into a female."</p><p>But JoJo had a change of heart in the weeks that followed, though she is adamant to point out, "I don't think my grandma influenced me."&nbsp;</p><p>"As far as my breast augmentation goes, my need to have the surgery kind of plateaued," she admitted, adding that "it's not really there anymore."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I think it was little bit of my own soul-searching," she continued.

I realized it's my genitals and how my true feelings and true emotions are for bottom surgery."</p><p>While the process to be approved and eventually get bottom surgery is a long one, JoJo is "1000% sure that bottom surgery is something that's going to help me."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In order to&nbsp;move forward with the process, she is beginning family therapy "to get my grandma to understand what this is and what it means and why I need it."&nbsp;</p><p>We're so happy for JoJo and the progress she's made!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">&amp;quot;It&amp;apos;s a girl!&amp;quot; says Dr. Marci Bowers &amp;#x2014; Noelle got her bottom surgery!</h2><p>So much of I Am Jazz Season 6 dealt with raising the funds necessary for Noelle to get her gender-affirming surgery. Jazz really showed up for her close friend and threw her a fundraising drag ball, in addition to starting an online campaign, and recording an original song of her own to help raise funds.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>All of the efforts really pay off because Noelle ends up raising $19,900 by the time her surgery date arrives. "We raised enough money there to officially get me to the surgery, which I am so thrilled for because right now the remainder is just so that we don't have to overwhelm my parents' debt," the resilient teen proudly declares.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With the help of trusted surgeon <a href=#>Dr. Marci Bowers</a>, who also helped perform some of Jazz's surgeries, Noelle comes out of hers without any complications—and 36 inches of depth!
