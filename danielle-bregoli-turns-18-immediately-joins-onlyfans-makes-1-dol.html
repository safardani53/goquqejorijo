Danielle Bregoli’s rap career as Bhad Bhabie was an overnight success, but it all started when she was acting out in a toxic household.
She turned 18 one week ago, and almost immediately launched her OnlyFans account."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

At 18, they can simply profit from it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>A number of sex workers who are all too familiar with the "grooming" concern note that … lots of people start their jobs at 18.</p><p>Not all jobs that require that someone be an adult have anything to do with sex or nudity.</p><p>(I worked in a grocery store deli at that age and I had to be 18 to be allowed to use the meat and cheese slicers)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Sex workers and advocates have noted that it’s not contradictory to be leery of grooming and support sex work.</p><p>Like, you can support any job and the workers who do that job. Any job. Firefighters, accountants, journalists.</p><p>That doesn’t mean that you like the idea of minors being tricked into signing up for those jobs, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We simply do not know enough about Danielle’s personal and professional life to know if some creeper close to her talked her into this.</p><p>For now, there’s not enough information to know if we should be concerned for her.</p><p>Well, not any more concerned for her than we were a month ago. She has led a difficult, traumatic life.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WBcLDAp6CepJyaeqO%2BxKCmpaFdqcKzutJmaHFlmaK6prDImquepKlit7C1zaxkqKacrrOiutJmpJqjlah6cnnDqKNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anthony-anderson-gives-advice-to-his-son-nathan-details.html><span>←</span><span>Anthony Anderson Gives Advice to His Son Nathan: Details</span></a>
