Now, the New Yorker has gone global — he currently has 280 stores throughout the world, his namesake ready-to-wear collection, covetable accessories and a successful beauty line. And just last week he launched a new division of the brand called The Marc Jacobs, which will feature everything from cotton printed T-shirts to sequin cocktail dresses and casual slippers to patent-leather pumps, all at a more wallet-friendly attainable price point. It will also highlight collaborative collections created with brands like Liberty and Schott, and Jacobs’ famous friends, including Stephen Jones, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sofia Coppola</strong></a> and graphic artist Milton Glaser. Jacobs’ close-knit circle also extends to Hollywood A-listers who wear his ensembles on the red carpet for unforgettable style moments. Anyone who dons one of his creations, Jacobs tells Us has “confidence and irreverence.”</p><p>The current collection, Jacobs explains, “references designers that have always inspired me, and our past collections that have inspired me, things that I continually go back to.” The ‘80s-influenced pieces consist of dramatic frocks in grand shapes, exaggerated silhouettes and extreme details (think giant ruffled collars and oversized layers of crinkled organza). A particularly notable embellishment: feathers, like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rita Ora</strong></a>’s $6,200 ostrich high-low top, which she paired with $9,900 silk wide-leg pants. “Rita can pull off anything, she’s great!” Jacobs says. Also, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Zendaya</strong></a>, who rocked a $13,500 head-to-toe feather frock, of which Jacobs simply said, “Zendaya in this dress, I love the chic of it all!”</p><p>Another show-stopping look was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross</strong></a>’ remarkably oversized silk organza tiered gown with embroidered petals (worth $15,720!). “Tracee can wear anything! She turns it out in a major way,” Jacobs enthuses. For his take on a traditional mini dress, Jacobs pumped up the volume for a one-shoulder multi-layer creation worn by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rowan Blanchard</strong></a>. “Ruffles look so fresh on beautiful Rowan,” Jacobs muses.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll through to see how more A-listers including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kerry Washington</strong></a> and <strong>Lucy Boynton</strong> make their mark in Jacobs’ unique and unconventional outfits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvCnqOemqNitq95zJqpnGWalrCwrtJmm6udo6iytHnKnqmrsV2srrS0yKeeraeeYrqwvsRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-mason-silva-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Mason Silva Dating Now</span></a>
