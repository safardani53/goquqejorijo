It was a little over a minute, and Dobrik and D'Alessio portrayed a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>With the song 'Getaway' by Saint Motel, the duo promoted David's Perfume's two debut scents. Over a year after the release, D'Alessio revealed she was not paid for the advertisement.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She went on Dobrik and <a href=# rel=follow>Jason Nash</a>'s&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Views</a>&nbsp;on January 20, 2022, and discussed the commercial. The YouTuber said that D'Alessio was the perfect girl to promote his perfume, and she did it well.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nash then asked if she ever got paid for the advertisement. The model said that she was not paid, but she was offered to pay by Dobrik's&nbsp;assistant Natalie Mariduena.&nbsp;</p><p>However, D'Alessio rejected the payment. Dobrik reminded her he had given her a watch as a gift. He joked he got it at the Bowling Alley via the claw machines&nbsp;for $3.95.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, D'Alessio appreciated the gift and said that she loved it and wore it "all the time." After the commercial was released, it broke the internet.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Therefore, it is no surprise that when Dobrik dropped the&nbsp;perfumes, it was an instant hit and sold out pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>David Dobrik and Charlotte D'Alessio for David's Perfume. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to David's Perfume's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, his #01 scent is the finalist for The Fragrance Foundation Awards, 2021.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a>, the YouTuber said that he was inspired by a stranger to start David's Perfume. The stranger had a fresh scent, and Dobrik was obsessed with it.&nbsp;</p><p>He believed that he "discovered a new smell" and wanted to give the experience to his younger audience. It took him more than a year to create the product, and he did so with the help of Vlog Squad.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Eventually, everything was finalized in 2020, and he released them in October of the same year. He started with two perfumes, but he has not expanded his brand to date.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is David Dobrik Dating&nbsp;Charlotte D'Alessio?</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After <a href=# rel=follow>Liza Koshy</a>, there Dobrik has been linked with many women. One of them is D'Alessio. The rumors started after the perfume's commercial was released.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>David Dobrik and Charlotte D'Alessio posing on a bicycle.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since they portrayed a couple, many believed that they were one in real life. However, Dobrik debunked the rumors in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Access</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He gushed about D'Alessio and said she was very professional throughout the advertisement. He also credited her for teaching him how to model and act.</p><p>But unlike the rumors, the video was only to promote his brand, not their relationship. Therefore, regardless of how well they played a couple in the commercial, they are not dating.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRq7alecOomauhm2Kwqa3RpaatrJVisaK4xKyqoqddpbKzstSmnGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./american-pie-cast-where-are-they-now-jason-biggs-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>'American Pie' Cast: Where Are They Now?
