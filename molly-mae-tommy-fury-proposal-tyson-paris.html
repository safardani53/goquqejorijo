invited 300 guests to the traditional Traveller wedding.</p><p>In contrast, Molly-Mae had been planning a huge Disney-themed wedding, with a pal telling Heat: “Molly wants to book a castle somewhere in the UK, where they'd have a banquet from a Michelin-star chef, performances from famous musicians and a spectacular fireworks display.</p><p>"They also want it to be about their fairytale love story, with Bambi playing a big part of the ceremony.</p><p>"They're huge fans of Disney, so Molly will be wearing a princess gown and arrive in a horse-drawn carriage. She wants the full Cinderella experience."</p><p>But after taking on the bridesmaid role at best pal Francesca Britton’s Barbados wedding last month, it seems she’s keen to scale back.</p><p>"She no longer wants the extravagant great British wedding that she and Tommy previously imagined," a source told OK!</p><p>"Seeing Fran’s wedding has put her off the idea of a Disney-themed wedding, too. She’s still expecting to spend seven figures on her big day, but since having Bambi, she’s realised she wants a low-key ceremony surrounded by only her closest loved ones."</p><p>“She definitely has her heart set on getting married abroad, but she now wants it to be very intimate with just Tommy, Bambi and their parents and siblings."</p><p>Molly also said she found a "dream" wedding venue during a PrettyLittleThing shoot in Nice, France.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/molly-mae-fran-britton-wedding-823092250.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/parisfury1-521017152.jpg><h2>Family plan</h2><p>Tommy has made no secret of his desire to have a large family - just like his brother - and says him and Molly-Mae are on the same page.</p><p>He told The Sun in May: “I want four kids but it’s Molly’s body and she’s the one who has to go through it... I’m a big family man and come from a big family too and it’s something we talk about a lot."</p><p>When it comes to naming their baby, Molly-Mae and Tommy took a leaf out of the older Furys’ book, coming up with a moniker that could never be described as run of the mill.</p><p>Tyson and Paris share <a href=#>six children</a> - Venezuela, 12, Prince John James, nine, Prince Tyson II, four, Valencia, three, and baby Athena, who was born prematurely last August.</p><p>When baby <a href=#>Bambi</a> arrived in January, proud aunt Paris posted a beautiful picture of the trio with the message: "The biggest congratulations to this beautiful family."</p><p>In March, Tyson announced the couple were expecting a seventh child - with Molly-Mae quick to congratulate them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pictures-instagram-boosted-tyson-fury-779171251-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paris-fury-congratulates-tommy-molly-833876026.jpg><h2>Gal pals&nbsp;</h2><p>Shortly after meeting Tommy, Molly-Mae was thrown in the deep end, meeting the entire Fury family on a trip to Las Vegas, where Tyson was facing Otto Wallin in the ring.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterwards she trilled: "Tyson was lovely and Paris was lovely. The whole situation was really nice and I think it was the perfect situation to meet Tyson because he was boxing and training very hard so I just watched it and took it all in.</p><p>"I am looking forward to meeting them again properly soon, hopefully in a more chilled scenario. The family is amazing.”</p><p>A few months later in February 2020, Paris and Molly-Mae were pictured hanging out together in Vegas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paris-fury-5-mrs-fury-565362555.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tyson-fury-enjoys-breakfast-champions-728361772.jpg><p>To show how welcome she is in the close knit clan, Paris included her in a snap with her three other sister-in-laws, calling the five blondes "Mrs Furys" in one of her Instagram snaps along with her other three sisters-in-law.</p><p>Molly-Mae and Tommy also celebrated with the Furys after Tyson won his World Heavyweight Title fight against Dillian White in April last year.</p><p>The morning after, Paris shared a picture of the family in a restaurant captioned: "Family celebration."</p><p>In December, Paris sent a sweet message to Molly-Mae after missing her baby shower, writing: "You looked so beautiful today, and wish I could of made it back from London in time but anyways it looked a dream."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/120dba95-7ef6-4da9-a905-cde0a96e4187-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paris-fury-molly-mae-hague-522163701.jpg><h2>Northern homes</h2><p>Despite hailing from the south, Molly-Mae was happy to move closer to Tommy’s family in the north.</p><p>The former Love Islanders share a pad in Manchester, where both brothers were born.</p><p>Tyson and Paris live an hour away in Morecambe, in&nbsp;a £4million mansion, meaning the family can easily get together for family events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paris-fury-instagram-725969819.jpg><h2>Jetsetters</h2><p>Since finding fame Molly-Mae has become a high-flyer, jetting off around the world with her man.</p><p>Motherhood hasn’t slowed her down either, with trips to the Caribbean, Nice, Paris, Dubai and Greece in recent months.</p><p>Nice is a popular hangout for Paris and Tyson, who recently posted a picture outside their favourite luxury hotel on the French Riviera.</p><p>And Paris is often pictured with a private jet, as she flies off to another glam destination.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/www-instagram-com-p-crlz2naizbp-813883166-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/last-48-hours-epic-im-685848805.jpg><h2>Fashion queens</h2><p>Both women are naturally stylish with a love of designer clothes, but they are equally at home with budget brands like PLT, Zara and Primark.</p><p>They are often found in all-white or beige outfits, whether a chic suit or figure-hugging frock.</p><p>While they love to get glammed up for parties, they often share snaps of casual comfy tracksuits or crop tops and jeans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/molly-mae-paris-fury-763803828.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/molly-mae-paris-fury-763803825.jpg><h2>Reality show</h2><p>The two couples have now collaborated on a new Netflix reality show, At Home With The Furys.</p><p>While the programme follows Tyson as he exits the ring and tries to embrace retirement, it will also feature Tommy and Molly-Mae as well as dad John.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The filming of the show may well mean they are spending more time in each other’s company.</p><p>All good news for Molly-Mae -
