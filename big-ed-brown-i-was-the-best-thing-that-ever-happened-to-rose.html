She’s modeling, she added a second story to her sister’s house," he noted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"Today, I apologize. You’ve helped me in so many ways," Ed told her on 90 Day Bares All.</p><p>"I’m very happy. I’m growing," he acknowledged.</p><p>"I still have a lot to learn," Ed expressed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>‘But you admired me and you touched my heart," Ed told Rose, "even though it didn’t work out."</p><p>On screen, Rosemarie told Ed that she was "happy to accept" the apology.</p><p>She also expressed that she is happy for anyone who might want to one day have children with him, as Ed froze his sperm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I don’t really regret it because, first of all, it already happened," Rosemarie expressed.</p><p>"I accept everything because that’s the past and it became part of my life," she explained.</p><p>"And also, for me to regret it, for what? For what purpose?" Rose asked. "Am I right? Because I moved on already."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Well, I’m happy that you’re happy and I don’t regret meeting you at all," Ed assured her.</p><p>"You changed my life for the better. So thank you," he concluded.</p><p>Meanwhile, it seems that lessons that Ed did not learn from Rose are continuing to make life more challenging than it needs to be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>Big Ed decided to ask out a 29-year-old (at least, he thinks that this is her name), even though he is 55.</p><p>“I’m glad that I’m wearing a mask to cover up my facial expression,” Liz confessed to the camera when Ed was out of earshot.</p><p>“I guess I just never really pictured him asking me out," she added.

As for the "spark," we’ll have to wait until next week to find out.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8o7XGZpydZZKnvLi6jKJksJmjYsGpsYybnKysXam1qrrGZquhmaRisrex0WafmqigmrumsIytpmaqn6iycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nate-bargatze.html><span>←</span><span>Nate Bargatze</span></a>
