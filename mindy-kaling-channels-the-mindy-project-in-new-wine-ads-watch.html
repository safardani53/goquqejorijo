Well, sort of. <a href=#><strong>Mindy Kaling</strong></a>, who created the eponymous series, channeled her inner Mindy Lahiri in a trio of funny new ads created to promote Barefoot Wine & Bubbly’s new boxed wine called Barefoot On Tap.</p><p>The spots, which debuted on Wednesday, May 15, each feature the 39-year-old actress bringing attention to a new phenomenon sweeping the country: JOMO — the “Joy of Missing Out.” As the opposite of “Fear of Missing Out” (FOMO), JOMO invites wine drinkers to embrace a night in with a glass of Barefoot instead of going out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Mindy-Kailing-barefoot-wine-.jpg><p>In one of the videos, for example, the Ocean’s 8 star passes up an invitation to a friend’s birthday party in favor of staying home in her pajamas and drinking booze from a box. “Sometimes home is where the party is,” Kaling quips. “That’s the joy of missing out.”</p><p>In another spot, the Office alum ditches dinner plans with pals and opts for a girl’s night in instead. The final video features Kaling creating a last-minute work emergency as a way to avoid going dancing with friends. “There is no way I’m going out tonight,” the Emmy nominee tells the camera. “I’ve got takeout, Barefoot wine and 14 hours of true crime burning a hole in my DVR. This murder isn’t going to solve itself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Barefoot-box-wine.jpg><p>Billed as the “ultimate JOMO companion,” Barefoot On Tap, is now available nationwide in six delicious varietals: pinot grigio, chardonnay, rosé, moscato, cabernet sauvignon and pinot noir. Each box holds four bottles of wine, which can stay fresh for up to 30 days.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“In our uniquely Barefoot way, we offer fans a fun and creative way to experience the joy of missing out,” Anna Bell, vice president of marketing at Barefoot, said in a <a href=#>statement</a>. “We’ve all had those nights where curling up on the couch sounds so much better than going out. We hope Mindy’s message encourages people to embrace that night in with a glass of Barefoot On Tap.”</p><p>These ads mark Kaling’s latest foray into the food world. Back in March, the star took it upon herself to celebrate <a href=#>National Oreo Day</a> by taste testing several flavors of the popular cookie in an Instagram video. “I’m not sponsored by Oreos, but I love them, and I thought I would do a taste test because there is so many different kinds,” she said at the time, before declaring Most Stuf Oreos her favorite variety.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqahnpnGbrfApaCnn12YtaK6zZ6jrGWknbJuucinm7JloKe8q7HCrWSipl2jsrh51qKlnmWRmcBuw8CtmqFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-slams-fan-who-blasts-khloe-for-working-amid-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Slams Fan Who Blasts Khloe for Working Amid Scandal</span></a>
