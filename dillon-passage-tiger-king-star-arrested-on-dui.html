Apparently he had a very good time.</p><p>It is difficult to imagine why someone would be going out to party during a pandemic … but then, drinking and driving doesn’t make much sense, either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Dillon’s husband Joe Exotic is … well, a deeply polarizing figure.</p><p>His critics say that he’s a monstrous animal abuser. The court felt the same way, which is why he’s in prison.</p><p>Joe’s fans don’t necessarily disagree with the facts, but ignore them for some reason because he’s a deeply bizarre man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Joe being gay and having been in a polyamorous marriage is not what makes him bizarre, of course.</p><p>He’s not the kind of representation that anyone in the gay community or polyamorous community asked for.</p><p>But his behavior, his branding, his personal sense of style, and his life decisions are nothing if not perplexing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Joe and Dillon met as a random dating app connection … not even two months after Joe’s husband, Travis Maldonado, died of a self-inflicted (accidental) gunshot wound.</p><p>Two weeks after that date, just two months after Travis’ death, Joe and Dillon were married.</p><p>All of that happened just a matter of months before Joe went to prison. For most of their marriage, Joe has been behind bars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Dillon is no stranger to substance abuse, as by his own admission he had a drug problem when he met Joe.</p><p>By comparison, driving while under the influence of alcohol is relatively minor, in terms of legal trouble.</p><p>It is still a dangerous activity — putting others at risk for no good reason, in the age of rideshares — and it is disappointing to Dillon’s fans that he did something so foolish.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Strangely, Joe Exotic — now serving a 22-year sentence — was almost upstaged on his own documentary by Carole Baskin, his archrival (whom he allegedly plotted to kill).</p><p>Carole is accused by many of having murdered her former husband, who simply disappeared at one point, leaving her in possession of all of his wealth.</p><p>It has rubbed many as weird that her alleged wrongdoing weighs more than his actual conviction. But it’s good to remember that no one in Tiger King, including Dillon, should be a role model.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z%2BcLDIpaOopl2lrrS%2FwKCcZqyZnLKzecqipaBlo6mus3nAq6meq6SasW67zWabrqFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Williams | Career, Family &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]</span></a>
