The game was going normal until <a href=#>Nikola Jokić</a> accidentally hit Suns’ defender <a href=#>Cameron Payne</a>.</p><p>Nikola tried to slap the ball out of Payne’s hand but ended up smashing his arms against Payne’s face.</p><p>Looking at the video issued from the official NBA recording, one can see that it was completely unintentional; it was an accident.</p><p>But Payne’s fellow teammate might have thought otherwise as he started walking briskly, eyeballing Nikola to a staredown battle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jokic-booker-fight-e1631197529943.jpg><p>Things got heated up real quick as <a href=# rel=noopener>Devin Booker</a> got furious. Nikola was not one to back down either; he went head to head with Booker with a puffed-up chest.</p><p>They pushed and pulled each other a bit, and the two were surrounded by players and officials in a matter of seconds.</p><p>The video shows Booker letting it go and backing off from the brawl. Some tweeted that he backed off because he saw Nikola’s two brothers screaming like blood-thirsty lions by the courtside.</p><p>Soon, the clip was all over social media, and people started noticing them.</p><h3>Nikola Jokić’s Brothers’ Reaction</h3><p>As a fight between Nikola and Booker broke out, the former’s two brothers were filled with rage. They had to be kept off the court by a couple of officials.</p><p>Nikola Jokić’s brothers were ready to get into action after their brother got into a fight in the middle of the game. Nikola’s giant, muscular, and scary-looking brothers did all they could verbally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/jokic-brothers-1024x768.jpg><p>If officials had failed to keep Nikola Jokić’s brothers off the court, we are pretty sure the NBA match could turn into an MMA match.</p><p>Videos of Nikola’s angry brothers went viral as they seemed more than ready to go fist-to-fist with Booker.</p><p>Later, Nikola was ejected from the game for a flagrant foul and unnecessary physical contact with the opponent. He was kicked out of the match just 4 minutes before the end of the third quarter.</p><h2>Nikola Jokić’s Brothers</h2><h3>Nikola Jokić’s Brother, Strahinja Jokić</h3><p>Strahinja Jokić was born in 1982 in Sombor, Serbia, and is <span>41 </span>years old. Information regarding his exact birthdate, education, dating life, etc., is currently unavailable.</p><p>Talking about physical appearance, Strahinja looks like a typical redneck with pent-up rage. However, he seems different from his younger brother Nikola.</p><p>Strahinja is made of two words, “Strah” and “inja.” “Strah” means “fear,” and “ini/inji” means “others.” The name roughly translates to “fear to others.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Strahinja-Jokic-and-Nikola-e1631197957912.jpg><p>In 2019, he was arrested for alleged assault. He was charged with choking and pushing a woman. According to Serbian media, the woman was his wife.</p><p>In addition, news reports read that he was with his wife in a Denver apartment and was consuming alcoholic drinks too.</p><p>The incident could have easily led to Strahinja being deported back to his homeland of Serbia.</p><h4>The Consequence of Assault Charges</h4><p>Assault is a serious crime, and even slight criminal activities can be enough to get immigrants deported.</p><p>This could have affected Nikola Jokić’s performance as a player and his mental and emotional state as a brother.</p><p>Since the news first surfaced online, a follow-up report has not been published. Many claimed that the charges against him were dropped later.</p><h4>What Fans And Followers Have To Say About Strahinja</h4><p>People say he is nothing but a 7 feet tall idiot with a drinking problem. Reports of him drunk driving violently have surfaced on the internet.</p><p>Basketball fans do not particularly like Strahinja for his immature and irresponsible behavior.</p><p>It is also rumored that his arrogance has been rising with his NBA star brother’s amount of money. He also yelled at Serbian reporters before the FIBA world cup to “f**koff” and leave Nikola alone.</p><p>Regarding the assault charges, one of the NBA fans commented, “I’m&nbsp;glad that this happened in the USA because here (Sombor, Serbia), he wouldn’t have any charges against him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nikola-Jokics-brothers-getting-trolled-on-twitter.jpg><p>Moreover, he also said, “He won’t go to jail, his family has a lot of money to pay expensive lawyers, but it will be a serious enough thing for him to understand that he has to behave, and the USA is not Serbia.”</p><p>Similarly, a Denver Nuggets and Nikola Jokić fan commented, “I have no sympathy for this thug; I am only worried how this will affect Nikola’s game. We all know how close he is with his brothers and how often he brings his emotional baggage to the court.”</p><p>Likewise, another fan pointed out, “Jokić is such an emotional player I can’t imagine this not hurting his on-court performances.”</p><p>One of the people that lived in the same building as the Jokić brothers said, “Used to live in their building. This dude was a scary mf.”</p><h4>Rare Positive Comment</h4><p>One of the rare positive comments read, “I train with him and his second older brother at the gym that I go to. Strahinja is super nice and friendly to me. He told me where to check out in Serbia to take landscape photos.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/A-positive-commement.jpg><p>The same user also claimed, “He and his other brother told me to let them know when I go to Serbia so they can show me around. So shocking to hear about this! I hope he seeks counseling for his alcohol addiction.”</p><h4>Is Strahinja Jokić a Sore Loser?</h4><p>As we already know, Strahinja is full of rage and a short-tempered man. He spent some time playing basketball in Europe but could not earn any success.</p><p>“He is not that talented, but he hates losing,” said Nikola Jokić. Nemanja and Nikola reportedly said their older brother’s playing style resembles Kendrick Perkins’.</p><p>Nemanja and Strahinja both used to go to Ball Arena, but Strahinja was the one who would usually get engaged in games.</p><h3>Nikola Jokić’s Brother, Nemanja Jokić</h3><p>Nemanja Jokić was born in Sombor, Serbia, the same as his other brothers. Nemanja was born on Aug. 26, 1984.</p><p>He was the youngest child for over a decade until Nikola was born in 1995. He is also the shortest of the three brothers, standing at 6 feet 6 inches (198 cm), and he weighs around 220 lbs (100 kg).</p><p>Nemanja played basketball for Mechanical High School at West Backa, Serbia, and maintained a 20-point average score.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nemanja-Jokic-e1631198472445.jpg><p>He graduated from the University of Detroit Mercy with a major in Business Administration.</p><p>Like Strahinja and Nikola, he played college basketball for the Detroit Mercy Titans. As a freshman, he reportedly played 29 out of 30 games for the Titans.</p><p>He reportedly claimed that the most thrill he got from sports was when he got the chance to play college basketball in the United States.</p><p>His skills are compared to that of Nikola’s, and it is said that they were similar in style and ability.</p><p>In the 2008/09 season, he led the university team with an impressive nineteen 3-pointers.&nbsp;</p><p>He entered the 2010 NBA drafts hoping to play with an NBA league team, but unfortunately, he went undrafted.</p><h3>Nemanja Jokić’s Career</h3><p>Nemanja is also a professional fighter and made his MMA debut in 2018. However, the MMA fighter has not been active lately and remains undefeated as a mixed martial artist with a 3-0 record, all by knockout.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Nemanja-Jokic-Records-back-in-2009-1024x206.jpg><p>He also competed in amateur Muay Thai and faced William Vandervier at the SCL: Army vs. Marines 10 event in 2021.</p><p>Jokic dominated the entire fight and finished it off with a spectacular and devastating knockout head kick.</p><p>He now travels cross-state, attending his brother Nikola’s matches. Any other information regarding the profession he is engaged in is currently unavailable.</p><h2>A Brief Bio of Nikola Jokić</h2><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Born on February 19, 1995, Nikola plays center for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p><p>Nikola grew up in a small two-bedroom apartment with his parents, grandmother, and two brothers.</p><p>Nikola spent the majority of his childhood shooting hoops. His two elder brothers were interested in basketball and played it too, which sparked his interest in the sport as a child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nikola-jokic-brothers.png><p>His love for basketball was also the result of his big brothers’ influence.</p><p>At an early age, Nikola exhibited some exceptional basketball skills and was quite popular in the city. Thus, he was known as the “basketball player.”</p><p>He joined Mega Bemax, a Bel-grade-based basketball team after he turned 16. Nikola played for the Junior team in his first season playing for Mega Bemax.</p><p>Soon, the club recognized his talent and promoted him to the next season’s senior national team. In 2005, he won the Top Prospect award and achieved the title of the most valuable player in the league of the Adriatic League.</p><h3>Awards And Accolades</h3><p>Fast forward to 2014, Nikola was drafted as the 41st overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. Just a season in the game, he proved himself a worthy pick and an excellent asset for the team.</p><p>Similarly, in 2016, he was entitled to the honorary title of the NBA All-Rookie Team. On top of that, he ranked 3rd in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.</p><p>The following year, in 2017, he was the runner-up of the NBA Most Improved Player Award and the Assist of the Year award voting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nikola-Jokic-kiss-e1631198815925.jpg><p>Moreover, Nikola also holds the record for the fastest triple-double in the history of the NBA league.</p><p>In 2021, he earned the MVP of the Year award, which made <a href=#>Shaq O’Neal</a> more than happy.</p><p>“You’re the first big man to win an MVP in a long time. I thank you, and I appreciate you very much,” said O’Neal to the Serbian giant.</p><p>Jokic became the NBA’s lowest-drafted player and the first player in Denver Nuggets franchise history to be crowned MVP.</p><p>Jokic won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the second year on May 12, 2022, defeating finalists <a href=#>Joel Embiid</a> and <a href=#>Giannis Antetokounmpo</a>.</p><p>When he won his second consecutive MVP, he rode to the stables in Serbia on a two-wheeled cart drawn by his horse.</p><p>Moreover, after advancing to the playoffs as the 1 seed of the Western Conference, the Nuggets, led by Jokic and Murray, won the 2023 NBA championship.</p><p>In the 2023 NBA Finals, Jokic averaged 30.2 points, 14 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 steals, earning him the NBA Finals MVP.</p><h2>Nikola Jokić’s Brothers And His Relationship</h2><h3>Growing Up Together</h3><p>Growing up, Nikola Jokić’s brothers would bully him into doing things he did not want to. One of the wildest childhood stories is the one shared by Nikola.</p><p>Once, he refused to climb a tree, and the two older brothers decided to punish him for not obeying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nikola-jokic-brothers-1024x682.jpg><p>The punishment included holding his arms down and throwing knives around his head. This is, hands down, the most ridiculous thing one can do to their brother.</p><p>“That was a little crazy,” commented Nikola.</p><p>Nemanja recalls Nikola being tossed around from one bed to another by his elder brother, Strahinja.</p><p>He used to terrorize little Nikola during heated games on a plastic mini hoop. It seems that Strahinja was a sore loser since the early days.</p><h3>Present Day Nikola Jokić’s Brothers</h3><p>At present, the Jokić brothers are inseparable. Nikola Jokić’s brothers are so close that they reportedly live together with Nikola’s wife, Natalija Macesic, and daughter.</p><p>Nikola Jokić’s brothers are arguably his biggest fan.
