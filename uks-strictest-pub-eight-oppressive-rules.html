I'm unsure if I'm more offended by the wrong word being used, a random comma at the end of the sentence, the fact they want people's feet on display or the fact they evidently don't want any custom."</p><p>"The website says they are a family friendly pub! It would appear that unless you have children it is family friendly," wrote a third.</p><p>A spokesman from Boot & Shoe Inn said: "It's a brewery decision to ban them."</p><p>It comes after one of Britain's strictest pubs reopened with <a href=#>anyone who swears banned.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Meanwhile, a boozer in Edinburgh has a list of bizarre rules with one punter even claiming <a href=#>he got kicked out "for not being local".</a></p><p>And the Royal Oak in Wales also <a href=#>sees mobile phones banned, TVs nowhere to be seen</a> and any form of tech forbidden.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ354fJduaWpnpaDAbr%2FTq6CcrJWowW681JtknqGXncFuu8%2BpqZ6ro57DpnnRrqOeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-yellowstone-filmed-7975562.html><span>←</span><span>Where Is 'Yellowstone' Filmed?
