It is the latest tragedy to hit Britain’s wildlife centres in recent years, leaving us wondering just how safe our zoos and safari parks are.
And it is not just the potentially deadly risk to the keepers and visiting public of wild animals escaping and going on the attack."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
