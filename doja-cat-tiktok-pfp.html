And since eagle-eyed fans are looking to be fed with more music, some folks believe that time is coming very soon.</p><p>In a March 9 TikTok video, creator Jessica Golich pointed out that Doja has not only changed her PFP image, but she also deleted all of the posts on her page.</p><p>“She has changed her profile picture to a demonic creature with pretty eyelashes,” Jessica says with the image in the background. “Do you think that we got a new album coming?”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jessicagolich href=#>@jessicagolich</a><p>greenscreen LMAO Doja Cat literally is the alien of the music industry and it’s wonderful 👽👾🛸 dojacatprofilepicture dojacatsprofilepicture dojacattiktokprofilepicture dojacatfans dojacatsupremacy dojacatisbae dojacatismygf dojacatedits</p><a title="♬ Boss Bitch - Doja Cat" href=#>♬ Boss Bitch - Doja Cat</a></figure><p>While some folks in Jessica’s comment section think that a new album is certainly on the way, others protested with an explanation for the new image.</p><p>“I’m 99 percent sure that’s a picture of <a href=#>Krampus</a>, who is basically a Christmas demon commonly associated with being opposed to Santa,” one person commented.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@dojacat</span></figure><p>On the flip side, others pointed out the obvious trend of <a href=#>artists deleting past content</a> when they’re gearing up to release new music.</p><p>Upon our own investigation, we noticed that Doja’s “Planet Her” album link is no longer available, with a message that says “Oops are you lost? It looks like the content is no longer hosted on this link anymore.”</p><p>Not to mention, Doja’s recent Instagram posts showcase the same devilish theme, as her Feb. 26 post features her rocking a red knitted face covering while wearing a white crop top sweater.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Doja Cat (@dojacat)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, is Doja Cat releasing a new album?</h2><p>It appears that fans may not be far off with their assessment of Doja’s TikTok PFP change being connected to a new project.</p><p>In a February 2023 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Doja confirmed that a new album will be available for fans sometime in 2023 with more rap songs, but touring may not be an option.</p><p>“That was one of the greatest experiences,” Doja recalled to the publication about making the hit song “Vegas” which showcases her rap skills. “Because everyone knows 'Hound Dog' but I was able to give it my own spin. I went in and I was like, ‘Finally, I get to rap again.’ A lot of people discredit me, so it’s nice to just put another one in the f--king bucket for a great rap song.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Understandably, Doja did share that she is being very methodical with her move for the new project.</p><p>“But I do want to make sure that everything I’m doing right now in terms of recording is solidified before I make any decisions,” Doja told the outlet. “The baby hasn’t been born yet.”</p><p>Buckle up, Doja fans!
