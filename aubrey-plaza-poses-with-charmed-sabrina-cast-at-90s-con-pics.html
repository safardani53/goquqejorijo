Together, the trio worked together to fight evil while balancing their professional and romantic lives as 20-something women. The series, which became an instant cult classic, aired for eight seasons before its finale in 2008.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>On Tuesday, Fuller, 42 — who starred as Piper and Leo’s (Krause) son, Chris Halliwell, <a href=#>on the supernatural comedy</a> — shared Plaza’s post via his own social media, writing, “I believe I’m eating your beanie.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Plaza then later took to her Instagram Story to <a href=#>post more candid shots</a> with the cast including Combs, 49, Gregory, 52, and Fuller making silly faces with the <a href=#>White Lotus </a>star. She also shared a selfie with<a href=#> Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a> herself, <a href=#><strong>Melissa Joan Hart</strong></a>.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Renee, meanwhile, expressed her own excitement via Instagram over the fan convention.</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Can I still be adopted at 26? @thehmc @rosemcgowan @theshando what do you think? 😈🤟🏼🔪#Powerof3,” <a href=#>she wrote alongside her own snap</a> with the Charmed cast.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Dirty Grandpa&nbsp;actress has often been candid about her&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>love for all things spooky, taking after her Parks and Rec character, April Ludgate, who is&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>obsessed with Halloween.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In 2021, Plaza even released a children’s picture book, The Legend of the Christmas Witch, which<a href=#> she cowrote with creative partner <strong>Dan Murphy</strong></a>. The story follows the origin tale of Kristtörn and her twin brother Kristoffer, who get separated as children. While Kristoffer eventually becomes Santa Claus, Kristtörn turns into the Christmas Witch.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In October 2022, the duo released the follow-up to their&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>bestseller, titled The Return of the Christmas Witch.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“The Christmas Witch is Santa Claus’ long, lost twin sister, so she is part of the merry and bright crew,” Plaza said during a November 2021 appearance on the<a href=#> Today</a> show, in which she dressed up as the story’s titular character. “But she’s got a little chip on her shoulder. … She’s a misunderstood character, you know. People project things onto her and they call her evil, but I don’t think she’s evil at all. I think she’s trying to bring the true meaning of Christmas back, and her brother maybe lost his way.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>She added, “The Christmas Witch is all about nature. She’s a Yuletide witch, <a href=#>so she’s all about honoring plants and animals</a> and remembering the old-timey traditions of the witch’s solstice.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Ingrid Goes West star shared that she <a href=#>dedicated the book to her mother</a></span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>, <strong>Bernadette Plaza</strong>, who “taught me to be a little witch as a child.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“She always had a kind of magic in her step,” Aubrey gushed at the time. “She always inspired me. She had me very young and taught me that anything was possible. … She’s a magical woman.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWwqO%2BxLJkqaSRr65uvM6snKxlp57BqXnCoZirpZWZerStwaugp5ldmK60wIyaq2ZxYKh6pLvNZqeim6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-yellowman-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Yellowman Dating Now</span></a>
