It’s a lot of colors, a lot of waiting in line, a lot of funny noises sometimes,” Bama Hager, a program advisor with the Autism Society of Alabama, told the Birmingham-based <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Daily Mountain Eagle</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Parents of Teen Living with Autism Share Early Christmas Miracle: ‘A Dream Come True for Him’</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, “The sensory Santa idea is to remove some of that sensory input so that a family with a child with autism or any developmental disability doesn’t have to be too concerned about all of that stimulation.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Autism Speaks and Cherry Hill Programs have teamed up, too, to bring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sensory-Friendly Santa</a> events to malls across the country, and families from California to New York City can RSVP to attend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These visits to Santa feature dimmed lighting, soft music, and early hours, so that none of the other stores are open and the mall’s corridors aren’t flooded with noisy holiday shoppers. The Santas are also equipped with different techniques to help them better interact with children with special needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Palisades Center, a mall in West Nyack, New York, has welcomed a special Santa for many years, Keri Cunningham, marketing director for the mall, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Journal News</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">J.R.

It would be too overwhelming and too much to handle.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar experiences have popped up in places like Wisconsin, too, where a local art shop recently hosted a Santa Claus event that featured sensory toys, noise-canceling headphones and crafts for each child, ABC affiliate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WAOW</a> reported.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The events have even expanded across the border, with Canada’s Southcentre Mall in Calgary hosting a sensory-friendly Santa for three Sunday mornings in December.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s exciting,” mom Kaylee Bushell told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CTV News</a>. “We can come, they get to see him, we get to enjoy the moment, and we’re on our way.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many children with autism have sensory issues that include both hyper-sensitivities and hypo-sensitives to a wide range of stimuli, including sights, sounds, smells and touch, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Autism Speaks</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8yao6WrXZ67tb7OnaycnV2hvLh50p6lrKeirnq0rc2tmGadqKWys7XEp5qeq12gtqW%2FjJqsraGjonw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./love-island-olivia-zara-jessie.html><span>←</span><span>I was on Love Island and Zara gives me the ick, Tom should be with Olivia and Jessie is playing a ga</span></a>
