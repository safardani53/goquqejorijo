Knock!</strong></p><p><strong>Who’s there?</strong></p><p><strong>Enzo and Damon?</strong></p><p><strong>Enzo and Damon who?</strong></p><p><strong>Enzo and Damon, we’re now cold-blooded, ruthless killers who slit the throats of our victims and hang them upside down by their feet in some random warehouse… that’s who!</strong></p><p>Not very funny, is it? Yet that is how The Vampire Diaries Season 7 came to an end.</p><p>We went into the finale with Bonnie as a vampire slayer, still under the control of Rayna’s final mortal life and still out to take down all her friends.</p><p>But Enzo lured her away to the cabin for long enough to allow Damon and Stefan to enter the Armory and burn the body that would free Bonnie from this curse.</p><p>Check that: make it only Damon who went into the Armory, as he amended for many of his past sins by telling Stefan to step outside and reconcile with Caroline… just in case some serious sh-t was about to take place.</p><p>Stefan obeyed.</p><p>He and Caroline made out (after Alaric nobly let her go, acknowledging that they and the twins would always be a family, but, come on, she clearly still loved Stefan) and then they waited.</p><p>Viewers watched as Damon successfully freed Bonnie from Rayna’s curse, actually doing the right, selfless thing for once.</p><p>So everything ended on a happy note, right? Not exactly.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>19 Best Shows in CW History: Ranked!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>That darn Darkness thing lured Damon into the vault by making him think Elena was calling for him.</p><p>After his friends failed to hear from him, Enzo went in to make the save… only to come across an especially wicked Damon and only to be grabbed/infected by the same unknown evil presence that had apparently stuck its claws into Damon.</p><p>Eventually, Caroline, Stefan and Bonnie broke into the vault, but it was too late. Damon and Enzo had somehow escaped.</p><p>And Bonnie was unable to track them because she never regained her powers.</p><p>Three months went by, with Stefan and company trying to discover the whereabouts of their friends and writing to Elena about what happened in their journals.</p><p>We then learned of various people around the country who went missing and we were then taken to the most disturbing scene of all:</p><p>Damon dragging a body over to Enzo. Enzo stringing the body up by its feet. And Damon slitting its throat.</p><p>"It never gets old, does it?" Enzo asked his partner in heinous crime.</p><p>"It sure as Hell hasn’t yet," Damon replied, as the camera faded away to reveal an endless number of corpses, all strung up in the same scary manner.</p><p><strong>What did you think of The Vampire Diaries season finale? A suspenseful cliffhanger? Or have we seen far too much already of characters acting out of character due to some kind of outside force?</strong></p><p>Heck, isn’t that what we just got done seeing in Bonnie?</p><p>Sounds off in the Comments section below…</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>24 Shocking TV Deaths</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2WCcMDHnmSvmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBuv8SaqqimXWx6przIrKadnV1nf26%2BxJyYqWWUpMKjuMRmrZqtnKl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./porsha-williams-daughter-name-pronunciation-baby-pilar-jhena-video.html><span>←</span><span>She Reveals How To Say Pilar Jhena Hollywood Life</span></a>
