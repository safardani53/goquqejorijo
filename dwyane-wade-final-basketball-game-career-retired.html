a splash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Miami Heat star, 37, wrapped up his final career game on Wednesday drenched in what appeared to be water, courtesy of his playful teammates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wade was giving a post-game interview when several of his fellow Heat stars came up behind him and tossed full Red Bull cups on the athlete.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He shared a photo of the celebratory moment to Instagram, captioning the post, “What a ending…. #onelastdance.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For his final game against the Brooklyn Nets, Wade put up a triple-double, logging 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Heat lost 113-94, though they had already been eliminated from playoff contention the night before.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I can retire and be happy,” he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a> afterward.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The star received a standing ovation at the game’s conclusion from the Brooklyn crowd, which included wife Gabrielle Union, and fellow players and friends Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James and Chris Paul.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Union celebrated the night by posing with the trio in a photo she shared to Instagram with the caption, “Bigger Than Basketball.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s been an unbelievable journey for my guy, and I’m happy to be here for the last little roll before that train comes to a stop,” James told Fox Sports Sun.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wade entered the NBA in 2003 at age 22 and spent 15 seasons playing with the Miami Heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As his career comes to a close, much has been made of Wade’s retirement, which has prompted tribute ads from brands like Gatorade and Budweiser.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gatorade teamed up with the athlete’s friend John Legend for a clip called “3 is the Magic Number,” a cover of the Schoolhouse Rock classic and a nod to Wade’s jersey number.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The commercial features highlights from his lengthy career as well as his many philanthropic efforts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Legend, along with wife <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chrissy Teigen</a>, was on hand Tuesday to watch Wade play his final home game in Miami, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>went viral</a> after a photo captured Wade stumbling backward into the couple’s laps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Budweiser also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>released a special ad</a> in Wade’s honor that features the star being given special gifts by people whose lives he’s touched, like the sister of Parkland shooting victim Joaquin Oliver, and a mother who received a shopping spree from the athlete after her house burned down before Christmas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His mother Jolinda, who spent time in prison and later became a pastor, also appeared in the video.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I am more proud of the man you have become than the basketball player,” she tells her son. “You are bigger than basketball.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0mibsLGRo7Juw8CdnGaemaOurXnBmqqknaSXrq24jKCYpp1dmK6zscSrZKudpJ6%2FprCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a
