The encounters continued, and they soon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>began a consensual, incestuous relationship</a> lasting around 10 years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her new book, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hopeful Healing: Essays on Managing Recovery and Surviving Addiction</a>, Phillips says that some family members still hold her accountable, and at one point disinvited her from a birthday party.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Another family member was angered that I might attend, and I was told she was just not willing to forgive me yet. She wouldn't forgive me! For abuses perpetrated against me as a child, or for exposing those abuses perhaps," she writes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Yvonne Hemsey/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Phillips, a former drug addict who is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>now a drug rehab counselor</a> at Breathe Life Healing Center, says that rather than holding on to the pain of being shunned by her family, she reaches out to her own counselor and loved ones for support.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've come to understand that some in my family have chosen to hold on to the pain and anger they felt when I came out with the truth about my dad," she says. "I understand that they're still caught in a textbook response of devaluing the victim and holding up the perpetrator."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I've also had to accept that, of course, I'd be the target of negative reactions and feelings because I'm the one who wrote the book and told a truth no one wanted to hear. If you're trying to maintain some sort of façade so you can avoid pain, the last thing you want is for the façade to be demolished."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Phillips' first book debuted in 2009, multiple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>family members spoke out against her</a> — some accusing her of lying, while others were upset that she revealed a hidden family secret when her father, now dead, was unable to provide a counterpoint.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Am I exceedingly joyful that my family secret that I told maybe my therapist, my husband and my very best friend in the whole word [is now public]? No," Phillips' half-sister, Chynna, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Oprah Winfrey</a> on an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How Soap Opera Vet Kim Zimmer Turned Her Anger into a Book</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I understand Mackenzie's need to come clean with a history she feels will help others, but it's devastating to have the world watch as we try and mend broken fences, especially when the man in question isn't here to defend himself," another of Phillips' half-sisters, Bijou, said in a statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hopeful Healing: Essays on Managing Recovery and Surviving Addiction</a> goes on sale Tuesday, Feb. 7.
