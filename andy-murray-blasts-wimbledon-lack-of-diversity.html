For him to say that is definitely inspiring, especially with him being a man and white. For someone like him to call for diversity, it shows how great an ally he is.</p><p>"It's important we do have diversity, because there are people from all over the world from different backgrounds and areas, and I think representation is important. At least for me, as a girl, seeing yourself in the media, seeing yourself being represented means a lot. I think that is important to other girls and boys. When they see [people like] themselves they might say, 'Oh, maybe because they did it I can do it.'"</p><p>Wimbledon have told SunSport that Britain's BJK Cup captain Anne Keothavong, who was born in East London and is of Laotian heritage, is being considered for selection to the AELTC board in December.</p><p>A statement said: "The AELTC is delighted that Anne has been nominated by the Committee to join the AELTC Main Board, however the process for nominations and election remains a private matter for the Club and its members until confirmed at the AGM."</p><p>A LTA spokesperson said: "We are already recruiting for new members of the LTA Council and are about to commence succession planning for new LTA Board positions with a particular focus on improving diversity&nbsp;</p><p>"As such we will be welcoming applications from those with a BAME background.&nbsp;</p><p>"As our CEO Scott Lloyd said recently in an open letter, we know there is much more to be done but we are committed to opening tennis up to people from any background.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Andy Murray reveals embarrassment after posting snap of his TODGER on social media while ‘out of it’ on morphine at op</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH50fI9rbWtuX5a7pcWMpqyrqpGueqO4wKyrrGWnnrqjuMSdpqdlnJawrHnOn2Sdoaaav7S107Jm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikita-ramos.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Nikita Ramos net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
