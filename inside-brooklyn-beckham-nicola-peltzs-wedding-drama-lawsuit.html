The suit claims that Braghin and Grijalba recommended that the Peltz family hire <a href=#>another wedding planner</a> after just nine days of working on the event.</p><p>The Plan Design Events cofounders were one of three sets of coordinators hired <a href=#>throughout the wedding planning process</a>. The lawsuit alleges that the pair overstated their abilities “regarding their experience, expertise and capability of planning the wedding,” noting that <a href=#>Brooklyn and Nicola’s celebrity status</a> as well as “the anticipated attendance of many high-profile guests” required excellence from the wedding planners.</p><p>Nelson also alleged in the filing that the two women missed meetings during their tenure with the Peltz family and made “references to <a href=#>alcohol use and possible abuse”</a> as a means of curtailing their stress over the event. On one occasion, the suit alleges, Braghin told Brooklyn, Nicola and her mother, <strong>Claudia Peltz</strong>, that she needed a tequila because her “head [was] about to explode.”</p><p>The party planning duo — who were allegedly hired just six <a href=#>weeks before the wedding</a> — responded with a countersuit of their own in February 2023, asking for more than $50,000 in damages and accusing the Peltz family of making difficult demands on short notice and communicating poorly. In addition to Nelson, Nicola, Claudia and wedding designer <strong>Rishi Patel</strong> are named in the filing.</p><p>The countersuit claims that the Peltzes were worried about Brooklyn’s mother, <a href=#><strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a>, finding out about hiccups in the planning.</p><p>“Both Claudia and Nicola had insisted that Victoria Beckham could not know about any internal mistakes regarding <a href=#>the ongoing planning of her son’s wedding</a>, including any errors with the guest list,” the filing claims.</p><p>The planners also alleged that Claudia didn’t want them to tell Nelson the cost of Nicola’s <a href=#>hair and make-up for the event</a> because he would “kill her and be so mad.”</p><p>A representative for Nelson told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail </a>that the countersuit is “replete with inaccuracies” and that the claims have “no merit”.</p><p>Brooklyn and Nicola <a href=#>announced their engagement in July 2020</a> after less than one year of dating. The pair previously cleared the air about rumors of drama surrounding their union after the Bates Motel alum sparked speculation that there was <a href=#>tension between her and her mother-in-law</a>. Nicola explained in her husband’s August 2022 <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> cover story that her decision not to wear a wedding dress designed by the former Spice Girl wasn’t a point of contention.</p><p>“I was going to, and I really wanted to, and then a few months down the line, [Victoria] realized that her atelier couldn’t do it, so then I had to pick another dress,” the New York native explained. “She didn’t say you can’t wear it; <a href=#>I didn’t say I didn’t want to wear it.</a>”</p><p>Brooklyn, for his part, <a href=#>wasn’t fazed by the ensuing rumors of a feud</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They’re always going to try and put people down,” he told the outlet of the trolls. “But <a href=#>everyone gets along</a>, which is good.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Beckham and Peltz’s wedding lawsuit drama:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNktq%2B%2FyJ2cZpqipLysuNinZJudk6C1ormMp6Ccp5yWerGxy62xrGWnmrGltc2gZJ2qkaKubrjAsKquoaRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hocus-pocus-cocktails-tiktok.html><span>←</span><span>Here Are TikTok's Best Hocus Pocus' Cocktail Recipes</span></a>
