I couldn’t stop.” Richards joined the online platform back in June 2022 after her daughter <a href=#>Sami</a> — who just turned 18 at the time — launched her individual account. The Starship Troopers actress shares Sami and daughter Lola, 17, with ex <a href=#><strong>Charlie Sheen</strong></a>. While Richards supported the teen's decision, the Two and a Half Men alum, 57, <a href=#>“did not condone” her business venture</a> at first <a href=#>but eventually came around</a>. “Denise has illuminated a variety of salient points, that in my haste, I overlooked and dismissed,” Sheen exclusively told Us in a statement via his publicist, <strong>Jeff Ballard</strong>. “Now more than ever, it’s essential that Sami have a united parental front to rely upon, as she embarks on this new adventure. From this moment forward, she’ll have it abundantly.” The World is Not Enough actress, for her part, opened up to Us about her thought process behind her and <a href=#>her daughter joining the platform</a>. “My parents were always supportive of my career and they didn’t judge me for decisions I made when I was working and starting out as an actress,” Richards exclusively told Us in July 2022. “I think it’s important — no matter what <a href=#>my daughters do</a> — to support them, no matter what. I want them to feel empowered and [to be] empowering them … and that’s something that I think is really important and something that I will always support.” She continued at the time: “I joined OnlyFans because one, I was not educated in what OnlyFans was at the time. My daughter got a lot of backlash when she signed up, which I thought was unfair. I really looked into seeing what OnlyFans is, and I think that it’s a brilliant platform. I think it really empowers the creator to control their content and to own the content, and also communicate with fans in a more dynamic way.” Keep scrolling to see photos from Richards and Spelling’s double date:<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwbC%2ByGaqqZ2cobavs4ydnKeho5p6s7XCoZirnKNitLB5zqdknaell7mmecOaq55lp57BqXnHrqqbmZ6ZwG68yJyqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelsea-ballerini-chase-stokes-matching-pajamas-holiday-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Kelsea Ballerini &amp;amp; Chase Stokes Wear Matching Pajamas in Holiday Pics Hollywood Life</span></a>
