Right before the band was scheduled perform, an announcer took the stage to say “unfortunately the show tonight has been cancelled as Liam has been taken ill.

When Chris asked if he can send Liam anything to help him feel better, Harry had one reply: “Pepto-Bismol.” When asked if it was a “stomach issue,” Harry said Liam was “just…very ill.” Harry&nbsp;tried his best to not be very gross about it, before he said, “it wasn’t pretty.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Liam <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>apologized profusely</a> to his fans following the last-minute concert cancellation.
