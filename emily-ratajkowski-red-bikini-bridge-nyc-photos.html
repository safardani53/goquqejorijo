The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>model</a> posed in a few different outfits, including a red patterned bikini from her swimwear line that put her behind on full display, as she spent time in New York City, NY, in the eye-catching snapshots. She was standing in front of a bridge and water could be seen behind her as her long hair was down and she rocked earrings and multiple necklaces.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The beauty also showed off a leopard print bikini with a short skirt, jeans, and a red patterned crop top with light brown cargo style pants and white sneakers. At one point, she added sunglasses to her look, and flaunted epic makeup that brought out her best features. She also had her hair up for some of the photos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>‚Äúcity girls all new swim for your summer @inamoratawoman,‚Äù Emily captioned the post, promoting her swimwear line.

She went topless and posed in high-waisted pants in some of the photos for the shoot. She also rocked crop tops and jeans and skirts for the others, as she gave a variety of serious looks to the camera.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Another photo shoot that she had around the same time happened<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> in Spain</a>. It had her looking unrecognizable as she showed off short blonde hair with bangs and held white plastic bags. She also donned a conservative outfit that included a tan sweater over a white collared top and a white knee-length skirt. She topped the look off with black slip-on short-heeled shoes that were tied in bows in the front. It‚Äôs unclear what the shoot was for, but it proved she can wear just about any kind of outfit and/or swimsuit and still look sizzling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e5JpZp6lmaHGbr7ArZijo5%2BswKy1jKucnWWSnriqushmmauhlJyybrrYnGSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./has-beyonce-ever-won-album-of-the-year.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Beyonc Has Won More Grammys Than Anyone What About Album of the Year?</span></a>
