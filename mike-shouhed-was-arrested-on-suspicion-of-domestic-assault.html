According to People Magazine, the 43-year-old celebrity was arrested on March 27, 2022. Officers from the Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) West Valley division arrested him and booked him on a felony charge.</p><p>Shouhed was arrested at 1:05 a.m. the next morning and detained until 6:35 a.m., when he posted his $50,000 bail and was freed. According to E! News, the star’s next court appearance is scheduled for July 25, 2022. In a statement to People Magazine, Shouhed’s attorney, Alex Kessel, addressed the current arrest, saying:</p><p>“My own inquiry confirms that my client did not conduct any acts of domestic abuse.” I am certain Mike will be exonerated. Respect the assumption of innocent.”</p><p>He is presently engaged to Paulina Ben-Cohen, a reality TV personality. The pair announced their engagement in August 2021, soon after the conclusion of season nine of the Bravo series.</p><p></p><h2>Who is Mike Shouhed’s fiancée?</h2><p>According to her Instagram profile, Paulina, a television celebrity from the United States, is also a fashion influencer. She is presently employed with Fashion Nova, an online fast-fashion retailer. The corporation is well-known for using social media marketing, notably Instagram, for promotional purposes.</p><p>Although Paulina has kept her personal life quiet outside of the series, Page Six has disclosed information about her prior relationships.&nbsp;Tal Bahari, Paulina’s ex-husband, is an extremely rich guy. As an entrepreneur, he has acquired millions of dollars through participating in a variety of business enterprises, including serving as the CFO of his brother, Fred Bahari’s, fashion firm Cavalini, Inc. They have two children, ages seven and five.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mike-Shouhed-2.jpg alt="Mike Shouhed" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to public records, Paulina and Tal purchased a $1,900,000 property in 2014. Their marriage, however, did not last long. The cause for their divorce was not disclosed, but court papers indicated that Tal had begun the procedure. In August 2018, the couple’s divorce was formalized. Mike and Paulina have been dating since the eighth season of the reality program Shahs of Sunset. They both came out of failed marriages and found love with one other.</p><p>The Bravo actress confirmed her engagement at the ninth season reunion of Shahs of Sunset, which will be broadcast in August 2021.</p><p>“I begged her son’s consent to marry his mother, and I handed him the ring. We were in Hawaii, and I had discussed with the concierge where the most beautiful portion of the beach would be.”</p><p>However, the couple’s season 9 took a tragic turn when Paulina discovered graphic messages with another woman on his phone.&nbsp;Although Shouhed first denied any knowledge of the controversy, in an exclusive interview with E! News in May 2021, he accepted responsibility for his conduct. He stated:</p><p>“It was a gloomy period. We were going through COVID and being on lockdown, and I allowed the anxiety of going through that, along with boredom, cause me to do things I shouldn’t have.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mike-Shouhed-3.jpg alt="Mike Shouhed" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Throughout the ninth season of Shahs of Sunset, the couple’s relationship was a hot subject of discussion. Shouhed spoke all about his relationship with Paulina in an interview with Bravo Insider after they announced their engagement.</p><p>“When you’re dating someone, it’s truly something wonderful. And I’m not just dating her; I’m dating her two children, whom I adore, and it’s crazy to see them grow up and become little tiny grownups.”</p><p>Shouhed’s Instagram account has been removed after the issue broke, while Paulina’s account remains active. Her most recent snapshot with her fiancé was posted on February 14, as part of Valentine’s Day.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Mike Shouhed</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Real estate broker</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikoqOVYsCpu9ShnJ1lp5bAbq3Rq5ysrJWZerC6jKysrKiZmLawuoyonWacn6KytMDInGSaq6OWwq3Ajg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oscars-2017-wolfgang-puck-chocolate-statute.html><span>←</span><span>Chef Wolfgang Puck on His Chocolate Oscars</span></a>
