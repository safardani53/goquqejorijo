Grow some balls. Just f—ing tell the truth,” Jenni “JWoww” Farley snarled at Pivarnick during Thursday’s episode.</p><p>“I’m telling you the truth on everything right now. All you have to do is say, I f—ing sold the speech, who gives a f—?!”</p><p>“If you leaked it, good for you. If you didn’t leak it, I don’t give a f—! I am so done!” Deena chimed in, clearly over the drama.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At certain times, there was some actual progress, such as when Angelina made a pretty good point about how Jenni probably wouldn’t want any of her friends palling around with her ex-husband Roger Mathews.</p><p>Jenni admitted that she was wrong for venting her frustrations on social media, but then she revealed that the Sorrentinos have been involved in some sketchy behavior of their own.</p><p>For some reason, Mike wanted Jenni to come on his podcast and interview Angelina (even though he’s been the one conducting “the Investigation” into Pivarnick’s behavior).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Jenni also revealed that Mike’s wife Lauren Pesce called Angelina a “dirty little hamster” and encouraged the other castmates to block her on social media.</p><p>“He’s coming to us trying to expose you and going to you being very friendly. I defended you because I don’t like what Mike’s doing to you,” JWoww explained.</p><p>At that point, Mike and Lauren entered the conference room/lion’s den, unaware of what was in store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Mike turned the attention back toward Pivarnick, claiming that the entire cast doesn’t “agree with the way that Angelina lives her life or makes decisions.”</p><p>“That’s my f—ing business, Mike,” Angelina clapped back, prompting Mike to tell her her life was a “mess.”</p><p>Sorrentino then claimed that the idea of having Jenni conduct the interview was merely a “bad taste joke” and Angelina was “getting worked up about something that was never going to happen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“This is such a waste of a day, I’m jumping!” Vinny lamented in a confessional, as he pined for the pool party going on 30 floors beneath him.</p><p>“None of you talk about your own f—ing lives, how about that? Vinny, you had a girlfriend for how many years and nobody knew about it!” Angelina exclaimed, once again making a solid point.</p><p>“You’re the only one that does crazy s—!” Vinny retorted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Angelina got some set of balls to say she’s the only person that shares her life. We all share our lives. It’s just that you share your crazy life.”</p><p>Jenni argued that the entire cast “gave everything,” while Deena said she has a “beautiful family” whose fights would be “boring” to watch on TV.</p><p>(A montage of moments from the Buckner household confirmed this.)</p><p>“I’m an authentic person,” Angelina explained, leading Mike to ask, “because you’re a cheater?”</p><p>“Why do you care? Why does he care so bad about my sex life?” Pivarnick asked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Does he want me to set up a camera in my bedroom? I’m going through my own s—,” she continued, before turning to Jenni and saying:</p><p>“When you were going through your divorce, I gave you respect.”</p><p>“Because everyone gave that respect and I wasn’t f—ing dudes behind his back. Plain and simple. You’re messy and it comes back on us!” Jenni shot back.</p><p>At that point, Jenni lost it and went full JWoww, yelling at Angelina to “shut the f–k up” and shouting “I’M NOT F–KING DONE” in the “mother of teens” voice she’s worked out for the future.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We feel sorry for those teens.</p><p>And as all of this was happening, the pool party went on down below, and Vinny never got to show off his Chippendale dance moves to the ladies of the San Diego Hard Rock.</p><p>Clearly, he’s the real victim in all of this.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WFcLbWqK6wZZGjtKa4yKeYZqiZq66zusicomaZnpl6rrXKnmSsp6Knsq%2FAyKemZpmimnqju9OhZKygkZnGbq3FaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-elsie-hewitt-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Elsie Hewitt Dating Now</span></a>
