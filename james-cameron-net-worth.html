Here's what to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is James Cameron's net worth?</h2><p>The eldest child of five in Kapuskasing, Ontario, James Cameron became interested in filmmaking in high school. After enrolling in a community college in California, James learned about practical effects by reading other students' work on "optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology," per <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Syd Field</a>.</p><p>After seeing <a href=#>Star Wars</a> in 1977, James promptly quit his job as a truck driver and set off to make it in the film industry. By 1978, he had produced his first short film, Xenogenesis. During his time educating himself about filmmaking techniques, James was hired as a special effects artist. While he was the special effects director for Piranha, the original director left due to creative differences with producer Ovidio Assonitis, allowing James to direct a blockbuster for the first time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It was during the filming of Piranha that James had a nightmare that provided partial inspiration for The Terminator. He later sold the script to a colleague (and his later wife), Gale Anne Hurd, for $1, under the condition that he direct the film. James's career soon skyrocketed, leading to films such as Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, True Lies, <a href=# style=text-align:start>Titanic</a>, <a href=# style=text-align:start>Avatar</a>, and <a href=# style=text-align:start>Avatar: The Way of Water</a>.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, James Cameron's estimated net worth for all of his box office success is $700 million. Fans of his work shouldn't be too shocked, as both Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water alone have netted billions of dollars globally.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>James Cameron</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Director, Producer, Writer, Editor</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $700 million</p><p style=text-align:start>Director, writer, producer, and editor James Cameron began his filmmaking career in 1978, but things took off in 1984 with his film The Terminator, which he wrote and directed.</p><p style=text-align:start>Since then, James has made numerous award-winning films and some of the highest-grossing movies of all time, including Avatar, Titanic, and Avatar: The Way of Water.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birth date</strong>: Aug. 16, 1954</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birth place</strong>: Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birth name</strong>: James Francis Cameron</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Father</strong>: Philip Cameron</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Mother</strong>: Shirley Cameron (née Lowe)</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Marriages</strong>: Sharon Williams (m. 1978–1984), Gale Anne Hurd (m. 1985–1989), Kathryn Bigelow (m. 1989–1991), Linda Hamilton (m. 1997–1999), Suzy Amis (m. 2000–)</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Children</strong>: Josephine Archer Cameron, Elizabeth Rose Cameron, Quinn Cameron, Claire Cameron</p><p>In addition to his film exploits, James is a sea explorer and has contributed to many documentaries with National Geographic exploring the deep sea, including Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>James Cameron and wife Suzy Amis Cameron</p></figure><p>James's dedication and interest in deep-sea exploration led to his becoming the first person to pilot a solo descent to the bottom of the Marianas Trench in 2012 on the Deepsea Challenger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66usdJmmpqllae8r3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwak%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-works-her-long-toned-legs-in-short-jean-shorts-w202373.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Works Her Long, Toned Legs in Short Jean Shorts</span></a>
