A well-placed source gives us the&nbsp;scoop![jwplatform 7MX7z8lH]</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Selena was blindsided by Nick’s reference about her on’ Area Code,'” a source tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “She had absolutely no idea that he was going to drop that into a record and is a little surprised Nick would do something like that, especially because they have mutual friends in common.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>However, despite being kept in the dark by Nick, Selena has absolutely no hard feelings towards him. She, better than anyone, understands the need to pour your heart out about a former loved one. Just think, “Good For You” clearly feels like it was written with her ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>, 21, in mind.</p><h3>Click to buy Nick Jonas’ album on Amazon</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Selena isn’t too disheartened. In fact, she thinks it’s fair game,” the source continued. “It would be hypocritical of her to slam someone for writing about their past love-life experiences considerin<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>g she’s written songs directed at her former boyfriends</a>. It’s the creative right of an artist, and Selena understands that better than anyone.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The new song comes just a week after Nick and Selena&nbsp;were seen getting cozy at a VMAs after party in LA on Aug. 30.&nbsp;Our sources told us EXCLUSIVELY, “He was whispering in her ear cause it was so loud with music and people talking in VIP. He had no other choice. She was loving the attention for sure and she talked to her friends about him&nbsp;afterwards, but his intentions were not romantic at all. They talked very briefly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>What do you think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Are you surprised by Selena’s reaction?
