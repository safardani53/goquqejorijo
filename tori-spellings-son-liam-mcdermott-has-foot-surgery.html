In the November 15 interview, McDermott <a href=#>talked about</a> the Instagram post that announced their separation and shared that Spelling told him that he needed to go to rehab after drunkenly posting about their marital problems. He’s since completed 40 days in rehab over the summer and is now living in a sober living home with eight other men.</p><p>“All Tori’s ever done to this day is want me to be happy and healthy and I inflicted a lot of damage and pain on that woman. I’m taking accountability for that today,” Dean told the Daily Mail, confirming he and Spelling are separated. “And it’s the biggest amend that I’m ever going to have to make.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since his split from Spelling, McDermott has been spotted out with <a href=#>Lily Calo</a> multiple times including dropping her off at LAX, where the pair shared a kiss.
