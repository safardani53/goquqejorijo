He holds a Hungarian Nationality. Furthermore, he grew up with a Romanian-born Hungarian parent.</p><p>His father is Zsigmond Bobroczky, and his mother is Brunhilde Bobroczky, and he has no siblings.</p><p>Robert was born under the zodiac sign of Cancer and is a Christian. On the one hand, Robert’s father is a former basketball player standing at 7 ft 1 inch.</p><p>On the other hand, his mother is a former handball and volleyball player with a 6 ft 1-inch height.</p><p>Indeed, Robert’s father played professional basketball alongside the tallest player in basketball history, <a href=# rel=noopener>Gheorghe Muresan</a>.
