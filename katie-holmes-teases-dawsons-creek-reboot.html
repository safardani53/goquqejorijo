However, she noted that the show may not be as welcome in today’s political and social climate.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“We all loved the experience. There’s a protection that comes along with the discussion. The show was a time capsule,” the 44-year-old actress explained. “To put it into today’s world might tarnish it a little bit. It was right before everyone had a phone and social media and all of that, so there was an innocence that was there between the characters that was one of the things I think people liked about the show. To put it into the setting of today’s world, I’m not sure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Katie-Holmes-Dawsons-Creek-ss-embed-11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>For now, Katie said the show’s creators are waiting for the right time or idea to come along. “We kind of just keeping saying that until there is a real reason to do it, it hasn’t been something where people have said, ‘This is the take on it,'” she stated.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Dawson’s Creek debuted in 1998 and skyrocketed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the now mother of one</a> and her co-stars into fame. Her co-stars included <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>James Van Der Beek</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michelle Williams</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joshua Jackson</strong></a>, and more. The show centered around the love between Katie’s character of Joey and James Van Der Beek’s Dawson Leery, plus the things high schoolers go through with their friends.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>James himself has said he doesn’t think the show would work in today’s world, either. “It would be a tricky thing to do. It was a tricky show to make even back then,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Insider </a>on Tuesday, May 2. “It was a very, very specific tone, a very specific time. I don’t know what would be replicable or be doable. It was <strong>Kevin Williamson</strong>‘s creation that came from his heart and he is a brilliant writer who was able to be self-aware and yet sincere all at the same time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Katie-Holmes-Dawsons-Creek-ss-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>James also revealed he has banned his<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> kids from watching</a> it until he decides they’re old enough. He currently shares<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> six kids</a> with his wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kimberly</strong></a>: <strong>Olivia</strong>, 12, <strong>Joshua</strong>, 11, <strong>Annabel</strong>, 9, <strong>Emilia</strong>, 7, <strong>Gwendolyn</strong>, 4, and <strong>Jeremiah</strong>, 1. “I haven’t watched the show in so long, so I’ll need to go back and probably investigate at what age [is best],” he noted.”I’ve just kind of put it off-limits for now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Furthermore, Joshua Jackson shared the same sentiment as his former co-stars while speaking to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The Guardian </i></a>in Sept. 2021. “I think because the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Friends </a>cast were already adults when they were doing the show, it’s less jarring to see them now. If you put our mid-40s selves together on a couch now, with our creaking backs, it might shock people,” he hypothesized. “Nobody needs to hear Pacey grunting when he gets out of a chair,” he added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It doesn’t sound like fans will get a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dawson’s Creek reboot</a> anytime soon, but you never know!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5BxZqSZpJ6ybrTOpaSeq12psqK%2FxKxknZmnqLyvv4ycqZ6dm2K%2Fpq7OqKto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hm-tie-top-ganni-dupe-cheaper.html><span>←</span><span>Fashion fans are rushing to grab H&amp;amp;M tie top that looks identical to Gannis but is 115 cheaper</span></a>
