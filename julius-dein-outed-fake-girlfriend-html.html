Ex Girlfriend Once Called Him Out for Being Fake</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Julius Dein has amassed millions of views on his YouTube channel, thanks to his magic and pranks. However, the magician found himself in a messy situation when his ex-girlfriend, Madison Willow, made a video saying his magic acts were&nbsp;fake.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>That's not all - she further stated that Dein took advantage of her and even abused her when they were still together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The Couple Broke up in 2017</h2><p>Dein and Willow first&nbsp;started posting prank videos and vlogs on&nbsp;Dein's&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official channel</a>&nbsp;in 2016. But it came as a shock when all of a sudden, the 26-year-old magician uploaded a video in February 2017 relating to their breakup. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the three minutes video, the couple shared how they first met. Apparently, Willow joined his team as an assistant but ended up being much more than that. Once the video was made public, their fans were heartbroken to see their relationship end.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The reason behind the separation was that Willow had to go back to the USA as her grandmother was seriously ill. She also mentioned that she might be back to join Dein in his vlogs, but we all know that never happened.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, a plot twist came after a few months when Willow uploaded a shocking video claiming&nbsp;she was verbally abused and exploited.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Willow's Video on Dein Went Viral</h2><p>The same year, in August, a video&nbsp;titled 'The Truth About Julius Dein' went viral on social media when the YouTuber's&nbsp;ex-partner, Willow, uploaded the video claiming verbal abuse allegations.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She started the video by saying, “If you have ever been taken advantage of or verbally abused, this video is for you.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In the video, she claimed that the street magician approached her with a life-changing opportunity of being famous and appearing on his videos. As a young girl, she took the chance, but she regretted&nbsp;it every day.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also added that all the videos and pranks she appeared on were staged. She shared that the magician&nbsp;was a different person as soon as he appeared in front of the camera and made her do wrong things by yelling at her and verbally abusing her.</p><p>However, Willow tolerated all that because she was gaining popularity and was scared of him at the same time. Even after their breakup, she revealed that she was still petrified of him and didn’t know how he would react to her video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Dein Dated Estelle Berglin&nbsp;after Breaking up with Willow</h2><p>Post-breakup with Willow, the&nbsp;social media influencer, found love in&nbsp;Swedish model Estelle Berglin. They started dating&nbsp;in August 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On August 26, 2020, Dein even took to his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> to share his happiness on completing the couple's one-year together. In the post, he revealed that they met during his show in&nbsp;Sweden in 2019 and she immediately stole his heart. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Julius Dein and&nbsp;Estelle Berglin celebrating their 1st anniversary.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a>)&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>"Happy 1 year anniversary to my gorgeoussss diamond amazing girlfriend Estelle Berglin who stole my heart at my Sweden show last year," he wrote in the caption.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations for tolerating me for an entire year. You deserve a BIG medal&nbsp;( all my friends will agree). Thanks for being my biggest supporter, my rock, my role model, and for making me a better person. I [love]&nbsp;you.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The duo regularly&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appears together</a> in Dein's YouTube prank videos&nbsp;and vlogs.&nbsp;Even during the lockdown days, the couple entertained viewers through their funny videos, and it seemed like the two have found the perfect match in one another.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Though there have been assumptions of an Estelle Berglin & Julius Dein split, a picture posted on Dein's Facebook&nbsp;in March 2021, commemorating 30 million subscribers, clearly shows that the two are working together.</p><p>Since they haven't&nbsp;removed any older photos of each other from their respective social media,&nbsp;it is probably safe to assume both of them are together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He Was Linked With Other Girls in the Past</h2><p>In the past, Dein had&nbsp;dated a few divas, including British actress Amber Doig-Thorne. Although there's no official report on how long their relationship lasted, they dated around early 2016.</p><p>Besides, the magician was also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored</a> of dating singer&nbsp;Lauren Jauregui. In 2015, they were spotted together, leaving a club and Dein driving her home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmqq5qsHSZpueoZ5ivLbAxJ1kn5mbmnqotdGlnauhlaOxb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./years-american-actress-alexandra-breckenridge-s-tattoos-lifestyle.html><span>←</span><span>41 Years American Actress Alexandra Breckenridge's Tattoos and Lifestyle</span></a>
