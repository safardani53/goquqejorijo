Then in 2016, the sports racer completed his full season with the Kawasaki &nbsp;KX 450F. He finished the Motorcross season in the third position with&nbsp;three wins. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Maintaining his momentum&nbsp;with an&nbsp;impressive winning streak of nine wins in a row, Tomac rounded out the 2017 Monster Energy AMA Supercross season with a second overall finish. Moreover, the same year, representing the Kawasaki Team, the rider was named the AMA Pro Motocross Champion and won his first 450cc Championship.</p><p>2018 was a year to&nbsp;remember as he&nbsp;dominated the Monster Energy AMA Supercross with&nbsp;eight main events to his name. The 28-year-old became the first back-to-back Monster Energy Cup Winner in the sport's history in the last twelve years. The same year, he grabbed a whopping&nbsp;&nbsp;$1million, aka "Monster Million," when he won all three motos.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2019, followed by his winning streak and glory, the champion finished the AMA season pretty strong with second-place overall at Monster Energy Cup.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A year later, just when the world was about to shut down amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kawasaki rider was able to lead the table in the 2020 Monster Energy Supercross.&nbsp; He also&nbsp;won&nbsp;his first Monster Energy AMA Supercross 450SX class championship.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Upon winning his 2020 Monster Energy AMA Supercross, Kawasaki handed over their rider with a brand new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accessorized</a> Teryx KRX® 1000 side x side.
