Instead, this man has left me in thousands of dollars of debt and in a financial struggle.”</p><p class=p1>Leviss, 27, has not publicly acknowledged <a href=#>the speculation of a potential romance with Oliver</a>, though she is<a href=#> currently filming season 10 of&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a>&nbsp;</i>following her broken engagement to <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a>.

No doubt. It’s one thing to hear what someone said. It’s another thing to actually see the scene. It hurt and it was vicious.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Love Me As I Am&nbsp;</i>author added: “It was one of those scary moments.
