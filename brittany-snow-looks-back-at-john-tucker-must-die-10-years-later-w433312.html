<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Brittany Snow Looks Back at 'John Tucker Must Die' 10 Years Later</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Don’t get mad, get even! Like John Tucker, <a href=#><b>Jesse Metcalfe</b></a> got pranked during the filming of <i>John Tucker Must Die</i>. In honor of the film’s 10th anniversary, <a href=#><b>Brittany Snow</b></a> looked back at the 2006 comedy — and how she and her costars <a href=#><b>Sophia Bush</b></a>, <b>Arielle Kebbel </b>and <b>Ashanti</b> pulled one over on its hunky lead.</p><p>“The best prank that we played on Jesse, which didn’t go over well at the time, is that we printed out a bunch of shirtless pictures of him that were in magazines and put them all on set,” Snow, 30, tells <i>Us Weekly</i>. “He was so embarrassed and not happy with us, but we thought it was hilarious. But he handled it like a champ. I’m sure he wanted to kill us secretly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/john-tucker-must-die-jesse-zoom-1fa66eb3-252c-4df3-8e19-b1d4ebf6a1cf.jpg><p>Snow played Kate in the movie, a sweet and innocent high school student who’s enlisted by Beth (Bush), Carrie (Kebbel) and Heather (Ashanti) to date John and eventually break his heart. The three ladies, who John cheated on, plot with Kate to make his life miserable.</p><p>Snow’s favorite gag? “I still think that Jesse Metcalfe did a great job playing off that scene where he’s drinking all the estrogen and freaks out,” she says. In the movie, the girls tamper with his protein drink and he begins to cry during a basketball game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brittany-snow-penn-john-tucker-must-die-zoom-54a686cd-dee2-4ab2-bb62-c80b773d1008.jpg><p>Snow’s character eventually ends up with John’s younger brother, Scott, played by <a href=#><b>Penn Badgley</b></a>. “I hope [they’re still a couple]. I don’t know — figure like a high school sweetheart,” the<i> </i>actress tells <i>Us</i>. “I’m sure if they’re not still together, they are still really good friends because they listened to podcasts together and were the original hipsters.”</p><p>Snow thinks that Kate’s new relationships in high school helped her gain some confidence. “She’s probably doing something really smart and she’s probably broken out of her shell a little bit,” she says. “I loved playing a character that was so shy because I definitely was very shy back then and that was definitely the character that was most like me growing up. Maybe she’s a journalist of some sort. I feel like she was always interested in people.”</p><p>Snow has come a long way since <i>John Tucker Must Die</i>. The <i>American Dreams </i>alumna went on to star in other big screen hits such as <i>Hairspray </i>and <i>Pitch Perfect</i>. Recently, she even made her directorial debut with a video that features Jai Wolf’s “Indian Summer.” The project is a collaboration between her nonprofit <a href=#>organization Love Is Louder</a> and <a href=#>Gemio Band</a>, an LED bracelet that lights up when it responds to movement and music.</p><p>“I created a story in my head of someone who saw their crush at a party that we’ve always done and can relate to. And this bracelet is easier to find them,” she explains. “I really wanted to create the visuals of being young and having fun, but also getting lost in this magical world that I think a lot of people can feel that nostalgia towards.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/john-tucker-must-die-volleyball-zoom-893d8636-ec48-46ed-8241-f4ff614e420a.jpg><p>The video, like her charity, encourages connectivity and positivity. Snow launched Love Is Louder in 2010 to combat bullying and empower others to support and accept each other. Many promote the movement by writing “Love is Louder” on the palm of their hands. “I wanted it to mean something like, ‘Stop hate.’ And look at your hand and it can be with you the whole time,” she tells <i>Us</i>. “I thought it was a really simple thing that I didn’t think would take off so much. …&nbsp;it’s a good reminder.”</p><p><i>For more with Snow, read her Q&A in our Now and Then series:</i></p><p><b>US WEEKLY: What was your favorite scene in <i>John Tucker Must Die</i>?</b></p><p><b>BRITTANY SNOW: </b>I think it would have to be the initial volleyball scene where we get into a fight, because all of the girls and I were together. I remember it was early on in the shooting and we were just laughing so hard at the absurdity of throwing volleyballs at each other. We knew right away that we were going to click. We got along so well. … That volleyball scene was just ridiculous and I was getting hit in the head over and over again even though it hurt.</p><p>https://youtube.com/watch?v=DKGpHk4CHcQ</p><p><b>US: How many takes did you have to do?</b></p><p><b>BS:</b> It was a lot! I mean, I guess I only got hit in the head like five or six times. It was a really lame fight sequence. Maybe the lamest fight sequence of all time.</p><p><b>US: Was that actually Metcalfe in the thong scene or was it a body double?</b></p><p><b>BS: </b>No! That was actually him. Jesse and I were in the gym every morning before work and after work before filming that scene. It was just me and Jesse hanging out at the gym looking at each other like, ‘I can’t believe this is our lives.’ That was really him. He worked really hard!</p><p><b>US: Did you keep any props from set?</b></p><p><b>BS: </b>The scene where I’m on the boat with Jesse — I told the hair and makeup lady [that I wanted] a fun updo on the boat so it didn’t get messed up when it was windy. And she did this elaborate updo that’s so ridiculous! If you go back and watch the movie it’s like, ‘Why would Kate ever have that elaborate of a hairdo?’ And she put flowers in my hair … so I think I still have those flowers somewhere.</p><p><b>US: Do you think there would ever be a sequel?</b></p><p>BS: No, I don’t think there should be. I don’t even know what would happen! He already got what was coming to him.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmroaSprq%2FFjKylqK9dobywt9JmmZqbm2KutXnJqJ%2BnZaSqsKyx0WakrqukYrGqsYxqZ2axlZa%2FtHnLmqueql2sgXR%2FkmppaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-dee-ford-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Dee Ford Dating Now</span></a>
