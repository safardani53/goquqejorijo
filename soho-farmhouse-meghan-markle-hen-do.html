Because this Cotswolds farmhouse is a private members’ club with a celebrity guest list as long as your arm and a HUGE price tag to boot."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

There is also a lake — although you are not allowed to swim in it.</p><p>After my visit there, I still cannot decide if I love or loathe it.</p><p>The first surprise on arrival is the milk float. My battered Ford Focus is abandoned before it can get mud on anything, and I ride to my £330-a-night cabin (£250 for members) on an electric vehicle in a tastefully muted shade of green.</p><p>The price, by the way, excludes everything other than the wifi and a couple of cabin basics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000383971833.jpg><p>Luxury cabins can cost up to £725 a night.</p><p>But the place is spotless, like someone has been through the fields with a Dyson.</p><p>Even the elegantly fluffed sheep look freshly blow-dried.</p><p>Another thing is the smell... there isn’t one. There is no slurry or meadow flowers to scent the air, just the subtle waft of expensive perfume and entitlement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390817895-e1520539963421.jpg><p>Over at the cabin, a Farmhand (Soho Farmhouse speak for the shiny, young staff) waits on my every demand. Everything is coolly sexy — even the free condoms are left in a discreet cotton pocket by the basin.</p><p>There are pristine, never-worn wellies by the door and a bicycle with a jaunty bell and basket. An artisan luggage label hangs from the handlebars with my name handwritten on it.</p><p>The style is “countryside” but not the British countryside. There are no discarded sweet wrappers in the hedgerows, no tyres dumped in fields and no chintz curtains framing uPVC windows.</p><p>This is a countryside that can only exist in the head of someone who works in London and knows that nothing really works beyond the M25.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000189736259.jpg><p>As for activities, it is not just cycling, horse riding or a splash across the boating lake. A quick read of the Farm Facts reveals there is a helipad and tuk-tuk service, too.</p><p>I can even flag down a horse and cart to take me to yoga if I fancy something really old-school.</p><p>People are meant to make their own fun in the country but here it is all laid on, lest you get bored or don’t understand.</p><p>Over at the Main Barn, it is time for lunch and the place is crammed with a boatload of sparky types in Ray-Ban Wayfarers looking chuffed to bits with themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000385706507.jpg><p>On my way in I hear someone say: “Oh for f***’s sake, now I’ve got aioli all down my cashmere scarf.” Mothers trill above the sophisticated hubbub to marshal their children. There are a lot of Matildas, Cecilias and Ollies.</p><p>Everyone here is either famous and fabulous — or would sell a kidney to be. The latter is, unsurprisingly, the vast majority.</p><p>The wannabes frantically star-spot while trying to lounge around the untreated floorboards and overstuffed sofas looking like they don’t give a hoot.</p><p>They idly smoke cigarettes, chomp on radicchio and exude an air of, “We’re here, we’ve made it...and isn’t that the fit one off Holby City?”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390325910.jpg><p>That’s another thing. The original Soho House members’ club in London — the Farmhouse is part of the group — was always stuffed with stars, and this place has seen its fair share of A-listers.</p><p>Chances are you will be hoping for a glimpse of Pixie or Becks but get the drummer from a Nineties indie band instead, or some bloke off an insurance advert.</p><p>Having said that, Sam Smith shows me how the lockers work in the swimming pool changing rooms.</p><p>I am standing in a knackered M&S cossie clutching my knickers, leggings and top next to one of the world’s biggest music stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000390927017.jpg><p>Moments later, I am doing (half-a**ed) lengths in a stunning outdoor pool that overspills gently into the lake beyond with just my besties and Sam for company.</p><p>Where’s a smartphone when you need it? But photos and social media posts are frowned on here — a strange irony considering every activity seems tailor-made for a frenzy on Instagram.</p><p>From the glass jars of different coloured facial toners in the spa to the row of pastel bikes in ye olde courtyard, the polished whimsy gets under your skin.</p><p>Yes, I cry, I will have an espresso martini from the “cocktail float” then hop in a cart to make my 8pm booking at Pen Yen, the Japanese restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000385706520.jpg><p>It will not seem odd that Jonathan Ross is sitting two tables away because I am at Soho Farmhouse...and I, too, am a celebrity now.</p><p>Eddie Redmayne has been here. the Clooneys as well, and Daisy Lowe, Cara Delevingne and the Camerons. Some of that stardust must rub off.</p><p>There is even boozy bingo on a Friday night, at which I get hammered and flirt with a famous DJ whose name I cannot remember.</p><p>Hungover the next morning, I dread heading out for food when the breakfast van pulls up outside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000385706503.jpg><p>I can order anything I like and the chef will cook it on the van’s grill, then carry it inside to where I am sitting, slumped and regretful.</p><p>As I lounge in my PJs, restaurant-quality food is put right under my nose.</p><p>Hang on a minute, this is bloody amazing! The small voice muttering about how fake everything is was wrong — there is so much to love!</p><p>Suddenly, it will hit you: It is the PEOPLE that are awful here, not so much the place itself. It is a gorgeous, flawlessly efficient theme park full of tight-bottomed Londoners demanding almond milk lattes.</p><p>And now I shall probably never be invited back, nor get the chance to go dry-stone walling with Alexa Chung, or badger culling with Nick Grimshaw.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><p>Luckily, I indulged while I could. Plump with local sausages and all the avocado toast I could handle, I booked in for a £50 blow-dry after breakfast.</p><p>Lounging over a £60 pedi an hour later, I gaze out over a sunlit beech tree as the whir of a chopper beats down close by.</p><p>Soho Farmhouse is just like any other farm, really. Only with helicopters...and sushi.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announce they are inviting members of the public 'from every corner of the UK' to their Royal wedding</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5RwbWppaGp8tLvHqGSfmaKitbDB0p5kpp2Xna6vecyaqaSklWK1prqMnaZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sophia-di-martino-19831115-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sophia Di Martino (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
