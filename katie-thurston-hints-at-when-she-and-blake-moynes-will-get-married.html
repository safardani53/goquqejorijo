Not so fast. <a href=#><strong>Katie Thurston</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Blake Moynes</strong></a>, who got engaged during the season 17 finale of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, aren’t planning on walking down the aisle anytime soon.</p><p>On Tuesday, August 24, Thurston, 30, shared a screenshot of a text exchange with her sister, during which she was asked, “How soon do you guys plan on getting married?”</p><p>The former Bachelorette responded with a joke, writing, “Not soon at all. He’s Canadian. … So we have a lot to work through first.”</p><p>Her sister then responded, “He’s hot!!,” to which the <a href=#>Bachelor</a> alum added, “Yea he is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Katie-Thurston-Hints-at-When-She-and-Blake-Moynes-Will-Get-Married.jpg><p>Moynes, 31, <a href=#>first appeared on season 16</a> of The Bachelorette, competing for <a href=#><strong>Clare Crawley</strong></a>‘s heart. After Crawley, 40, decided to leave the show with <a href=#><strong>Dale Moss</strong></a> two weeks into filming, Moynes chose to stay with the hopes of forming a relationship with new lead <a href=#><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a>. At the end of her season, Adams, 30, got engaged to <a href=#><strong>Zac Clark</strong></a>.</p><p>Thurston and Moynes quickly connected when he arrived during week three of her season. On the finale, which was filmed in April, he popped the <a href=#>question with a Neil Lane diamond</a>.</p><p>“In the moment — because there was a moment where I didn’t think he was proposing — I was just happy to leave with him. I knew that was going to happen no matter what, [but] it’s hard to say the impact of that in the real world [if he didn’t propose],” Thurston exclusively told Us Weekly during a joint interview with her fiancé earlier this month. “You go through so much and you want to take this very seriously and a <a href=#>proposal and engagement</a> is very serious. I didn’t come here to find a boyfriend. I can do that on a dating app.”</p><p>She added that she’s <a href=#>not sure they “would have survived”</a> if they chose to simply continue dating rather than getting engaged. “The fact that we’re both committed to each other as future husband and wife, it just says a lot about our confidence in our relationship,” the bank marketing manager said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On Tuesday night, while <a href=#>watching some of the suitors from her season</a> on <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, she reacted live via her Instagram Stories. When one follower said she was “still obsessing over her exes,” she clapped back.</p><p>“Imagine being secure enough in your relationship and <a href=#>still supportive of a group of men</a> who went through something no one else will understand,” Thurston replied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSesm7Ax66prKyfo3qptc2tqmaZpGLEqbHNZqqhnV2Wu6V5waWYpJ1dory6usSsZLChnKF6qLHTZqSaqqKesqV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jay-z-beyonces-former-st-barts-rental-on-market-for-80-million.html><span>←</span><span>Jay-Z, Beyonces Former St. Barts Rental on Market for $80 Million</span></a>
