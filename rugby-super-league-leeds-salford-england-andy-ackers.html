The now former England hooker swapped Salford for the Rhinos, along with Brodie Croft.
Sharing journeys across the Pennines with the Australian half back, who also lives near his now former base, may be driving him nuts."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The traffic’s not too bad in the morning. I’m on the early bird, so I miss most of it!</p><p>“And having Brodie move with me was a massive factor in my decision. We’ve played alongside each other and been quite successful, so having him with me again is great.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>“Apart from the fact he’s seemingly addicted to peanut butter sandwiches. He even had one first thing in the morning!”</p><p>Ackers - who describes his switch as ‘more convenient at the time’ - had good reason to ask for today off as he reached his landmark birthday on Christmas Day but there was no chance of him missing the trial game with Wakefield.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Sport</h2></p><p>He wants to experience life in a <a href=#>Rhinos</a> shirt at Headingley as soon as possible as three more of boss Rohan Smith’s signings – Lachlan Miller, Matt Frawley and Mickael Goudemand – will also make their debut.</p><p>And his new surroundings may see him live up to his new billing as he added: “It’s pretty special playing for such a prestigious club with a lot of history. It’s one I’m proud to play for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RLackers26-CREDIT-LEEDS-RHINOS-AND-MATTHEW-MERRICK-PHOTOGRAPHY-2.jpg><p>“And Rohan’s great. Speaking to him was one of the factors behind the move and he’s quite similar to Paul Rowley at Salford in how he sees the game.</p><p>“Also, how he wants to play expansively. I’ll also learn new roles under Rohan. There are many professional people around the club – if I can add anything to that, it would be a privilege.</p><p>“I’m 30-years-old now and I’m progressing into being a leader – I want to progress myself even more though. It’s a young squad at Leeds and if I can add any experience and lead by my actions, that will be fantastic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/RLackers26-CREDIT-LEEDS-RHINOS-AND-MATTHEW-MERRICK-PHOTOGRAPHY-1.jpg><p>“I’ve never played on Boxing Day before and it’s something I’m looking forward to. It’s an early start too, so I can have the&nbsp;rest of the day with my family. I want to pull on a Leeds Rhinos jersey, though.”</p><p>Ackers’ move has meant he has had to put his other day job – as a barber in the Farnworth area of Bolton – on hold until he works out when he can fit it in.</p><p>And despite friends’ quips, there is one certainty.</p><p>He told SunSport: “I’m never going to be a Yorkshireman. I’ll always be a Lancastrian!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fZFuaWxrX6fCqK7YZqquqJWneq2xwKCsnmWcmrKlv4ysmKWen6exbrHNoKOappRirq%2Bw2GaYnKOVp8Bw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joel-dawson.html><span>←</span><span>Joel Dawson</span></a>
