The fee is placed with supposed good intentions, as several states want to encourage customers at retailers around the country to recycle and protect the environment.
Costing around five to 10 cents, the surcharge is reportedly added to the purchase of bottled drinks, specifically those in plastic packaging, per Kitchn.
