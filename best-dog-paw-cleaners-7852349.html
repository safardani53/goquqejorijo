They are easy to use and convenient to grab every time you and your dog come into your home. There’s a tight lid closure to keep any moisture from escaping, and the lavender scent adds a lovely touch to the whole experience. While the wipes have many hydrating ingredients (and are good for most dogs to use on a daily basis), if your dog has extremely cracked or sensitive paw skin, you might consider an even gentler option since wipes can sometimes dry out your dog’s paws with frequent use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What Pet Owners Are Saying:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Living in New York City, my dog’s paws do not pass my apartment threshold without a good wipe down.

For instance, if it’s really hot outside and you are worried about your dog’s paws getting burned on sand, concrete, or any other surface — this can be a good step in the cleaning process. For highly irritated skin, we’d recommend simply using a damp cloth for an initial clean, and following up with this balm to coat and soothe the area. It’s packed with nourishing oils and butters that work quickly on your dog’s paws. You should make sure it’s dry before you send your pet on their way (and a good belly rub after application often ensures time for that).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What Pet Owners Are Saying:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“There have been two seasons when this balm really comes in handy,” says Yauger. “In the summers, when my dog encounters hot sand on sunny beach days and in the winter, when the sidewalks are salted in the city —&nbsp;both experiences can cause paw irritation and this balm works wonders on the texture and health of my dog’s paws during these times.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz. | <strong>Type:</strong> Balm | <strong>Star</strong> <strong>Ingredients: </strong>Mango butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil, camomile, rosemary, vitamin E | <strong>Free of: </strong>Fragrance and preservatives</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-well--good-pet-on-the-go-paw-cleaner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Travel</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Well & Good Paw Cleaner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Petco Well &amp;amp; Good Pet On-The-Go Paw Cleaner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FoL3AVElEqv_sk6v6EEFQkGMKKA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/well--good-pet-on-the-go-paw-cleaner-7c4e1eb2d6754bcc8b1608d8ab168145.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Petco</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you frequently take your dog with you on adventures, whether hiking in a national park or taking a cross-country roadtrip, the Well & Good Paw Cleaner allows you to clean your dog’s paws easily wherever you go.

The Warren London Paw Sani-Scrub brings soothing ingredients like aloe vera and antioxidants together with an effective scrub brush to thoroughly clean your dog’s paws and nails. This cleaning solution especially comes in handy when your dog has dried mud on their paws, or if they stepped in something unsavory that needs to be efficiently cleaned off. In addition to providing a superficial clean, this scrub also helps eliminate unwanted bacteria, fungi, and other germs that can accumulate in between your dog’s paws.
