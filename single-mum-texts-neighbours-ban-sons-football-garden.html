As long as it is not too early or too late then I think it is fine."</p><p>Someone else asked what exactly her sons are doing in the garden, writing: "What are they doing? Passing the ball, practising a few skills?</p><p>"Or repeatedly kicking/bouncing the ball on a hard surface making a constant thumping noise?</p><p>"There is a world of difference between quiet playing and making a racket, both of which they could be doing, and one of which is rude and unneighbourly, especially at an age where they could go to the park."</p><p>"They talked about the sound of the ball bouncing," the mum replied.</p><p>"The boys do make noise too to be fair, they’re calling to each other like you do when you play.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>"It was about 7pm on a Sunday when the message arrived.
