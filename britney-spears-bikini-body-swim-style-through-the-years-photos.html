After all, she makes sure to stick to a solid gym routine.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s3>“Well … for the love of God I finally see some <a href=#>definition in my abs</a> !!!

She switches things up pretty frequently, but she does her fair share of weight lifting with fiancé <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari</strong></a> and dances on the regular (just take a peep at her Instagram for proof!).<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p>[ami-related id="1485654" url="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/britney-spears-ups-and-downs-over-the-years/" title="Britney Spears’ Ups and Downs Over the Years" target="_blank" thumb="false" imgsrc="https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1998-84397994.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" imgid="1485651" format="gallery" flag="" channel="1"]<p class=p1><span class=s3>While Spears’ killer body remains a constant, her actual swim style has changed a decent amount over the years. Back in the early 2000’s, the superstar would opt for <a href=#><span class=s2>bolder looks</span></a>, wearing polka dot prints and bandeau tops.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s3>But as she has gotten older, she's started to keep it a tad bit more understated, donning solid hues and traditional bikini cuts. That’s not to say that what she wears poolside is boring by any means. Even though it may be on the simple side, little ruffled details and pretty colors keep her two-piece game strong.</span></p>[sendtonews type="float" key="jVzcAEM8e6-2835806-14453"]<p class=p1><span class=s3>Plus, her favorite looks don’t break the bank!
