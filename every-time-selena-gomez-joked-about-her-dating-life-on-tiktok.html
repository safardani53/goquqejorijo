Her early 2018 reconciliation with the “Ghost” singer came on the heels of her October 2017 breakup with <a href=#><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a>, whom she dated for 10 months. The Disney Channel alum has previously been linked to other A-list stars, including<a href=#><strong> Nick Jonas</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Orlando Bloom</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Charlie Puth</strong></a> and more.</p><p>In a January 2020 interview with the Wall Street Journal, the “It Ain’t Me” artist revealed that she had “been single for over two years now.” She was <a href=#>more than happy on her own</a> at the time, explaining, “I need time by myself. I love going to my room at the end of the day. Just me and my dog. I got the full granny panties situation, stretched out in my bed.”</p><p>However, Gomez’s perspective on her relationship status seems to have shifted in the time since.</p><p>“No, I’m fine. I’m totally fine being single. It’s a real thing. I’m fine,” the actress <a href=#>deadpanned</a> in a May 2022 TikTok video, pointing the camera at two couples cuddling on the couch next to her. While her friends giggled in the background, Gomez gave the camera some major side-eye.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the Wizards of Waverly Place alum’s career is going full-speed ahead — Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building is <a href=#>gearing up for season 2</a>, she’s working on her new album and launched her Rare Beauty line — she still makes time to joke about her love life on social media.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see everything Gomez has said about her dating life on TikTok:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bJkraGdmnq0scuepZpll6S6psaMo6aknZRirqO71K1koZ2iYrGiwMinnmakmZuybrvNZquio6SkuHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bee-vang-19911104-html.html><span>←</span><span>Bee Vang (Actor de Cine) - Edad, cumpleaos, biografa, hechos, familia, patrimonio neto, altura y</span></a>
