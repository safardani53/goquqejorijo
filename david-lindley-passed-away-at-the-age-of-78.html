He died as a result of a sickness, and a campaign was started at the beginning of 2023 to help settle his medical expenses. Singer and lyricist Warren Haynes paid homage to Lindley by posting a photo of her performing a musical instrument on Facebook. Lindley, he said, was a genuine artist with a unique sound on the instrument he selected to perform. Lindley, according to Haynes, had a major influence on him. Haynes stated:</p><p>“I’ve always placed David on a small list of significant inspirations on my slide playing- particularly on the rhythmic side. Lindley’s impact often comes to mind when I’m tackling a tune or performance in a major key. His singing technique was vocalesque, and his sense of rhythm was profound.”</p><p>Lindley’s partnership with Jackson Browne became popular in the 1970s, according to Haynes, and the passages were so well-known that even non-musicians could “echo along.” Leland Sklar, a bassist, also shared his sorrow on Facebook, writing:</p><p>“We have lost one of the most genuinely distinctive and exceptional musicians and companions in history! David Lindley was the only one like him. Always in my heart, earth, and rhythm. My thoughts are now with you and your lovely family. I’ll mourn you, my sibling.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/David-Lindley.jpg alt="David Lindley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter Users Pay Tribute</h2><p>David Lindley has earned a reputation as a faultless performer over the years.

Kaleidoscope was formed in 1966 as a result of this, and the ensemble produced six recordings.&nbsp;When Kaleidoscope disbanded in the 1970s, David collaborated with several other bands before forming El Rayo-X in 1981. However, the ensemble disbanded in 1989. He regularly worked on albums by musicians such as Warren Zevon, Curtis Mayfield, James Taylor, Terry Reid, Bob Dylan, Rod Stewart, and others.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/David-Lindley-2.jpg alt="David Lindley" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lindley was well-known for his work with Jackson Browne, and he added to the majority of Browne’s efforts, including Browne’s rendition of Maurice Williams’ Remain. David had a large assortment of instruments, but he once stated that he was ignorant of which ones he could perform.&nbsp;Lindley married Chris Darrow’s sister Joan Darrow in 1976, and the couple had a daughter, Rosanne.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqttc2do56xXaWutL%2FEnWSar5GueqLAjK2fnmWRnLJuu8VmbnFn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./corey-jones.html><span>←</span><span>Corey Jones</span></a>
