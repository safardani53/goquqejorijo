In this week’s “VIP Scene,” Us Weekly is breaking down the RHOC cast’s go-to hot spots while staying local. First up: The Quiet Woman!
The Corona Del Mar, California, eatery is one of the most-frequented restaurants in the show’s history.

Read between these lines you f—king bitch,” Shannon, 59, <a href=#>screamed at Kelly</a>, 48, during the heated exchange. “Get the f—k out of here.”</p><p>The awkward encounter resulted in all the Housewives leaving the upscale location in shame — but that hasn’t stopped <a href=#>Shannon from dining there now</a>.</p><p>“As far as restaurants go, of course we’re going to say The Quiet Woman,” Shannon exclusively told Us in September when asked about her “favorite” local food stop.</p><p>Pal <a href=#><strong>Vicki Gunvalson</strong></a> agreed before adding in R&D Kitchen and Gulfstream both in the Newport Beach area.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter</strong></a> picked San Juan Capistrano’s Five Vines Wine Bar — located not far from the famous Mission San Juan Capistrano — as her top restaurant in the area.</p><p>“I love Five Vines. That is my total jam. It’s also mine and <a href=#><strong>Travis [Mullen]</strong></a>‘s date spot,” Gina, 39, exclusively revealed to Us. “This is a good plug too because it’s a wine bar and I am sober, but it’s so much more than a wine bar.”</p><p>Gina swears by the eatery’s cheese and meat plate, gushing, “Just have everything! Their flatbreads [and] the spinach dip is to die for.”</p><p>If you’d rather be shopping than chowing down in Orange County, Vicki, 61, told Us that Alice + Olivia at Newport’s Fashion Island is a must.</p><p>“We shop at the same stores,” Vicki explained, referring to her and Shannon. The women noted that Neiman Marcus is also one of their go-to spots.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vicki added: “There’s not that many stores in Orange County, especially in the Newport Beach area. So we tend to all shop at the same places.”</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above for all the RHOC-approved hot spots — including the high-end space <a href=#><strong>Heather Dubrow</strong></a> used to launch her HD Network on season 17.
