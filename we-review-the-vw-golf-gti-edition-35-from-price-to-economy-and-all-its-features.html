No marks for originality boys.</p><p>But the GTi doesn’t need gimmicks or fancy names — the Edition 35 is a lesson in subtlety.</p><p>On the outside all you get are discreet 35 badges on each front wing, Bi-Xenon headlights with LED running lights and its very own sexy set of black and chrome-edged alloys.</p><p>There is a modest styling pack, with uniquely shaped skirts and front bumper, a unique rear spoiler and twin chrome exhausts, but it still looks very much like a standard GTi.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more motors</h2></p><p>It’s the same story on the inside where you get Edition 35 kick plates on the door sills, a unique gear stick with patterned head, plus a smart patterned door trim and leather sports seats.</p><p>One major change on the Edition 35 is a power hike from the 2litre turbo petrol of 25 PS on the standard GTi which sees 0-62mph arrive in 6.6 seconds, along with a top speed of 153mph.</p><p>There is a small price to pay on economy — that drops from 37 to 34mpg, but expect around 28mpg if you drive the 35 to its full potential. C02 goes up to 189g/km.</p><p>You also get a wonderful, deep, throaty engine noise, fabulously precise and assured handling, a super-smooth six-speed gearbox, a good degree of comfort and a permanent smile on your face.</p><p>For some people, 35 can mark the on-set of a midlife crisis. In the case of the Golf GTi, it is just getting better with age.</p><p>Prices start at £27,525 for the three-door six-speed manual and goes up to £29,405 for the five-door six-speed DSG auto.</p><p>But remember — GTis will retain their secondhand value and be in more demand than any other used hot hatch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxzgpduZ21oX6yybr7Er6Cer12ptaZ51bBkoKecm3qowMhmnJ2hpJ68r3mSbmSfqp%2BierG%2ByJycZqyfYrKku82opLJlkaOxbq3LpWSirKNis6at066pnqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-palladio-has-been-a-saving-grace-for-his-girlfriend-as-she-worked-through-abandonment-issues-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Palladio Has Been a Saving Grace for His Girlfriend as She Worked through Abandonment Issues</span></a>
