They thought it wasn’t a story about [Elle] getting a boyfriend, which was really cool to have people say that.”</p><p>Actress <strong>Jessica Cauffiel</strong>, who played Elle’s friend Margot, claimed in the same interview that a third alternate ending implied that Elle and Vivian had gotten together as a couple.</p><p>“The first ending was Elle and Vivian in Hawaii in beach chairs, drinking margaritas and holding hands,” the White Chicks star, 45, said “The insinuation was either they were best friends or they had gotten together romantically.”</p><p>McCullah, however, later denied this in a tweet responding to a story about Cauffiel’s recollection. “I wrote the movie,” she wrote on Thursday, July 8. “I’m in the picture you just posted. The actress quoted was incorrect.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The She’s the Man writer later told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> that she didn’t want fans to be sad that the movie didn’t end with Vivian and Elle dating because such an ending never existed at all.</p><p>“It made me sad to see people mourning something that never existed, and being sad that it was taken from them,” she explained on Friday, July 9. “So I just wanted to clear that up. Don’t be sad!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmenaOaeri106Gcq6ugpLyvec%2Boqq2rXaGyqK3LpbBmmpyku6WxjJqjrZ2io661sYyepZ2hnpx6sbXCrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hot-photo-90-day-fiance-big-ed-1988-viral.html><span>←</span><span>Photo of 90 Day Fianc Star Ed Brown in 1988 Goes Viral</span></a>
