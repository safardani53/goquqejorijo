He is looking for the same thing in a relationship and wants six kids.</p><p>According to his Bachelorette bio, Greg is not afraid to admit that he cries during movies, his biggest pet peeve is slow drivers, and he dreams of seeing <a href=#>LeBron James</a> play in person.</p><p><strong>Read our <a href=#>Bachelorette live blog</a> for the very latest news and updates...</strong></p><h2>Did Greg leave the show?</h2><p>While Greg received the first impression rose this season, his spot as No. 1 might be taken over following the August 2 episode.</p><p>Following a confession of love during Hometowns week and more bonding over their fathers, Greg supposedly <a href=#>left the show</a> after Katie couldn't confirm that she will choose him.</p><p>After confessing his love, Greg told Katie, “I don’t know what else to show you at this point, or what else to do. I’m not going to get down on one knee twice. It’s a one-deal thing for me.”</p><p>Katie then responds, &nbsp;“I just love looking at you.”</p><p>Greg was not a fan of that as he then said, "I just don’t understand how you don’t know... that it’s me and you at this point, I just don’t get it."</p><p>The next morning the two continued the conversation but the results were not in Katie's favor despite telling Greg that she is in love with him too.</p><p>“Am I wasting my time?” Katie asked. “I’m telling you everything, and you still don’t even believe me... I’m losing you, I’m losing my mind here. This whole thing was for nothing if you leave.”</p><p>“I deserve more than what I’ve been given on your side,” Greg replied. “I’m not happy here anymore... I’m done here.</p><p>It's unknown if Greg is actually <a href=#>done with the show</a> or if his <a href=#>performance</a> is all part of the dramatic affects of reality television.</p><h2>How tall is Greg Grippo?</h2><p>Greg measures in at 6' 3" tall.</p><p>His height played a role in his basketball career as he is a former NCAA college athlete who played for Saint Michaels College, a private, Roman Catholic, liberal arts college in Colchester, Vermont.</p><p>During his basketball career, he was the team captain and never missed a game his junior and senior year.</p><p>Greg is almost a foot taller than his Bachelorette star as Katie is between 5'4" and 5'6" tall.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659263826-1.jpg><h2>Is Greg Grippo an actor?</h2><p>Prior to his Bachelorette days, Greg pursued a <a href=#>career in acting.</a></p><p>Before coming on the show, he attended William Esper, between 2017 and 2019.</p><p>Fans noticed that before coming on the show, he deleted evidence from his social media accounts in relation to attending the NYC-based acting school.</p><p>While he is still a fan favorite, some believed that he was too good to be true and was using his fame on the show to start up his acting career.</p><p>"Greg thought he could pull a fast one on the audience by just not acknowledging he’s a trained actor and pretending to be some marketing guy," and insider told The Sun. "I don’t think he has the purest intentions going on the show… it just doesn’t add up."</p><p>In the Bachelor franchise history, there have been many people who come on the shows not for love, but to advance their acting career.</p><p>While Greg has not done anything suspicious on the show to allude to that, some fans find it a little shady he tried to delete the evidence.</p><h2>Who is left on this season of The Bachelorette?</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more from the bachelorette</h2></p><p>Of the 31 original contestants, only three remain.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Those that are still left include:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZm5%2BeoOUaJ6rnZditLO1z6mmZqyYmnqjrcKhnKWnoprBtbGMpJitoZViwanB0ayrqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-beckinsale-reacts-pete-davidson-gisele-bundchen-dating-meme.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Beckinsale Reacts To Pete Davidson, Gisele Bundchen Dating Meme Hollywood Life</span></a>
