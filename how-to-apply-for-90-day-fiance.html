However, if your story is one that you believe needs to be told on television and you aren't afraid of giving up your privacy for several months, then it may be the way to go for you. Just don't be surprised if you gain haters as well as fans and followers when the dust settles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's how to apply for '90 Day Fianc√©.'</h2><p>From there, you'll get more information on casting for any given season of 90 Day Fianc√© and other shows in the franchise.

Some reality TV stars go on to have spinoffs of their own or other business opportunities thanks to their role on any given show. With 90 Day Fianc√©, it's no different.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From Chantel Everett's spinoff <a href=#>The Family Chantel</a> to Darcey Silva's, Darcey & Stacey, there's certainly an opportunity for some of the more notable participants on 90 Day Fianc√©. But if you apply for 90 Day Fianc√© and all you get is one season, you aren't walking away with much in terms of monetary compensation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch Weekly</a>, stars of 90 Day Fianc√© are paid from $1,000 to $1,500 per episode. And some couples aren't even featured in every episode of any given season. If they're in a longer season, like Season 9, which spanned 19 episodes, they could make close to $30,000 for their time. But a more standard season of around 12 episodes could result in a $12,000 check and lots of online scrutiny.</p><p>The latter comes with the territory. But it's not always worth it for 90 Day Fianc√© cast members to put themselves out there on the show. Especially since they aren't always lucky enough to have their K-1 visa approved. For those couples, their time on the show can end in heavy defeat.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At the end of the day, though, it's all about whether or not the show is worth it to you.
