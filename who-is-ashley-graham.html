She’s taking the modeling world by storm</b><br>Along with her SI cover spread, she’s starring in denim brand NYDJ’s "Fit to Be" campaign, Forever21’s new plus-size activewear campaign, swimsuitsforall’s brand <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>new #SwimSexy ad</a> going in the swimsuit edition, and Lane Bryant’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>#ThisBody campaign</a>. And that’s just in the last few weeks. Phew.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>2. Plus, she’s got a clothing line of her own</b><br>Graham got her start in lingerie modeling (to wit: “My first [modeling] job ever was lingerie,” she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>told Yahoo! Health</a>. “My mom had to sign a petition that said they would airbrush my nipples out!”), so it’s no surprise that she would start her own line of intimates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Graham <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>modeled the sexy collection</a> herself last September at New York Fashion Week (and unsurprisingly, she looked stunning).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>RELATED VIDEO: Meet Ashley Graham, the First Plus-Size Model to Be Featured in the SI Swimsuit Issue</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>3. She gave a sold-out TED Talk on body diversity</b></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Graham is open about feeling insecure about her body, and shared how she moved past it during her TEDxBerkleeValencia talk in Spain last May.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I felt free once I realized I was never going to fit the mold that society wanted me to fit in,” she said. “I was never going to be perfect enough for an industry that defines perfection from the outside and that’s okay. Rolls, curves, cellulite, all of it – I love every part of me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And she’s hopeful for a future where all women will feel just as confident.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This is the generation of body diversity,” Graham concluded. “The current is changing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>4. She wants to ditch the phrase ‘real women’</b><br>As someone with a body that skews closer to the average woman in the United States, Graham constantly hears that she represents ‘real women’ – but she’s not a fan of the term.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t like to use the words ‘real women,’ honestly,” she told Elle in February. “I like to use the word ‘woman.’ And I say that because there are so many women out there who are naturally thin, or are naturally curvy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think when we start putting a label on the type of woman it gets misconstrued and starts to offend people,” she continued. “At the end of the day we just all want to be known as women or models or actresses or whatever.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>5. She’s not afraid to throw shade at brands that diminish curvy women</b><br>Graham proudly posed for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Lane Bryant’s #ImNoAngel</a> lingerie campaign in April, which not-too-subtly critiqued the controversial Victoria’s Secret “Perfect Body” ads. And when Protein World put up their provocative posters with the words “Are You Beach Body Ready” next to a slim model, Graham wasted no time, posing for her own, body-positive version of the ad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0miuoaddnsBurdKho56xXZy%2ForTApmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uk-coolest-seaside-hotspot-ghost-town-parking-rules.html><span>←</span><span>We live in the UK's 'coolest' seaside hotspot - but it's becoming a ghost town thanks to 'ridiculous</span></a>
