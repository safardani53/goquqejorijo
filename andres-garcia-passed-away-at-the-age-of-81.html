He perished of hepatic cirrhosis, or serious fibrosis of the liver. Garcia had been ill for some time. His wife Margarita Portillo was by his side at their Acapulco home at the moment of his passing. Garcia got a blood transfer on April 2, 2023, according to Portillo, and his constitution was not too powerful. Portillo also shared her sorrow on Instagram, posting a photo of Garcia and writing:</p><p>“I want to inform the public that has always followed and loved my husband, family and friends, as well as the media, that my husband, Andres Garcia, the love of my loves, is resting beside our Lord Jesus.”</p><p>Garcia had returned home after receiving a blood transfer, but his body was exhausted, and she, along with her sister and caregiver, was by his side when he died. She went on to say:</p><p>“Andres departed from this terrestrial realm at 3:07 p.m. Starting tomorrow, April 5, at 9:00 a.m., his remains will be shrouded in this, his house, on Calle Urracas No. 20 of the Fraccionamiento Costa Brava in the city and harbor of Acapulco.”</p><h2>Cirrhosis of the liver: causes, signs, treatment, and more</h2><p>Cirrhosis, according to the Mayo Clinic, is extreme inflammation of the liver caused by various liver illnesses and conditions such as hepatitis or prolonged drinking. When the liver is damaged for whatever cause, it attempts to heal itself, which results in the development of scar tissue.&nbsp;When cirrhosis worsens, scar tissue grows and the liver becomes unable to operate correctly. Cirrhosis-related damage cannot be reversed, but it can be managed if detected early.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Andres-Garcia-1.jpg alt="Andres Garcia" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fatigue, bleeding, bruising, nausea, swelling, weight loss, itchy skin, yellow discoloration in the skin and eyes, fluid accumulation in the abdomen, spiderlike blood vessels on the skin, redness in the palms of the hands, pale fingernails, clubbing of the fingers, confusion, drowsiness, and slurred speech are all common symptoms, according to MEDizzy.&nbsp;Cirrhosis is more prevalent in people who drink heavily, are overweight, and have viral hepatitis. Reduced alcohol intake, a healthy diet, keeping a healthy weight, and lowering the risk of hepatitis are all ways to avoid the issue.</p><h2>Since 1967, Andres Garcia has worked in the entertainment business.</h2><p>Andres Garcia was born on May 24, 1941, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and was the son of Andres Garcia La Calle, the squadron leader of the Spanish Republic’s first firefighter squadron and Commander of the Spanish Republican Air Force during the Spanish Civil War.&nbsp;Andres moved to Mexico and quickly began pursuing a job in the entertainment business. During the 1960s and 1970s, he rose to prominence through his roles in films and television programs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Andres-Garcia-2.jpg alt="Andres Garcia" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>His most recent performance was in the Canal 5 series El Pantera, which broadcast from May 14, 2007, to November 26, 2009.
