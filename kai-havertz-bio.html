Although his parents’ names remain under review, the German has two siblings who are utterly fond and protective of their little brother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/havertz-865.jpg><p>Similarly, Leah and Jan Havertz are occasionally pictured on Kai’s social media in a family outing or gathering.</p><p>Despite his siblings’ occupations being unknown, the German midfielder’s mother works as a lawyer, and his father was an amateur soccer player and, at present, works as a policeman.</p><p>In fact, Kai’s father and grandfather’s amateur soccer career was an influencing factor in his soccer pursuit.</p><p>Likewise, the entire family lived in a neighborhood with a training ground in their locale, which was also a prompting factor.</p><p>Eventually, 4-year-old Havertz found an inalienable affinity towards football. Since Alemannia Mariadorf was closer to his home, Kai’s parents decided to enroll him in the particular academy.</p><p>Thereafter, seeing a bright future for their son in this sport, his parents set out building contacts with various clubs around Germany to impart a more professional finishing to a 9-year-old Havertz.</p><p>Leverkusen, Cologne, and Gladbach showed an eagerness to include him in their ranks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/havertz-863.jpg><p>Havertz’s youth career got handed to Aachen Alemannia. In the meantime, Kai would also focus on his education as there must be a fail-safe plan if soccer didn’t work out in the future.</p><p>Hence, the burgeoning footballer joined Landrat-Lucas High School, where he received his primary education.</p><p>Upon completing high school, Kai prepared to study for A-Levels while also playing in a top-flight league with Bayer Leverkusen.</p><h2>Age, Height, & Body Stats</h2><p>As of December 2023, the Chelsea midfielder is 24 years old.</p><p>Kai is remarkably tall, with a height of 6 feet 4 inches (1.95 m), which has become quite advantageous for his heading feat.</p><p>Similarly, he weighs an average of 83 kg (183 lbs). Even with such weight, Kai has a seemingly leaner body frame and is rather bony than muscular.</p><p>However, his physique has not dampened the skills; instead has been a trump card for the young German.</p><p>Agreeably, Kai can pick up more injuries, but the attacking midfielder can showcase the skills that captivate the viewers in awe while in-form.</p><p>It is baffling how a man of Havertz’s quality missed out on the Golden Boy Award as he was voted 3rd on the 2019 list.&nbsp;</p><p>However, awards don’t need to define this youngster’s potential of what he achieved with Bayer Leverkusen and now with Chelsea and the German national team.</p><p>Pundits have dubbed him as Alleskonner, the opposition’s nightmare, and judging how Kai plays, even fans like me can attest that this man has what it takes to be a top player- and as the Germans say it- Stark Spieler!</p><p>Additionally, the attacking midfielder possesses incredible pitch awareness and game visualization capability and, most importantly, drops back to the defensive line.</p><p>While not technically assisting in defending, Havertz drops back to collect passes and make a run to the opposition half to launch a counter-attack. Similarly, the attacker is adept with both his feet and even his head.</p><p>The soccer player has impressive acceleration, eyes for goalscoring, creates spaces, provides game-changing passes, and is also robust on-air.</p><p>Furthermore, Kai avoids the off-side trap to prevent the loss of open chances.</p><h2>Career: Club & Nation&nbsp;</h2><p>In the beginning, Kai gained actual football experience with amateur Alemannia Mariadorf. After playing six years at Mariadorf, the second-tier Alemannia Aachen signed an 11-year-old Havertz, who finally entered the sporting world as a professional.</p><p>Immediately, in the 2010 season, the top-tier German side Bayer Leverkusen swooped in to add to their youth forces. Subsequently, with the U-17 team, Kai scored 18 goals during the 2016 season.</p><p>He was already creating a sensation in the Bundesliga, and undeniably, the German national team’s future looked really bright.</p><p>Kai came on as a substitute for Charles Aranguiz on October 15, 2016, officially making a debut against Werder Bremen.</p><p>At the age of 17, the attacking midfielder became the youngest debut in the Bundesliga.</p><p>The Bundesliga recorded its 50,000th goal with Karim Bellarabi’s finish assisted by Havertz.</p><h3>Champions League Debut</h3><p>Due to an unfortunate suspension of Hakan Calhanoglu on February 17, 2017, the German national made his first-ever Champions League start in the Round&nbsp;of 16, wherein Leverkusen faced defeat at the hands of a composed Atletico Madrid.</p><p>Although the German side planned out a comeback for the second leg, Kai had to miss out on the March fixture against Atletico as his examinations coincided with the match date.</p><p>The club felt a massive gap in the midfield due to Havertz’s absence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/87606769_1487770111388465_4355334891008134236_n.jpg><p>Moving on, the attacking midfielder was lurking everywhere in a clash against VfL Wolfsburg and finally found an open net, thereby ending the match in a 3-3 draw. Moreover, on April 2, 2017, Kai became the youngest scorer for the club at 17.</p><p>During that season, Kai made 28 appearances in all competitions and netted four times, including a brace against the Berlin side Hertha BSC. Ultimately, Bayer finished in the 12th position.</p><p>There aren’t enough words to talk about the talent he exuded. Even if the spectator is rooting for the opposition, one cannot help but admire Kai’s playing style; alluring yet straightforward, it’s praiseworthy and intelligent all the same.</p><h3>Bundesliga Hero</h3><p>Observing a teenager impress on a big stage and playing in the top-tier in one of the best leagues is unfathomable.</p><p>However, the path doesn’t end for the youngster; we have yet to talk more about his flourishing career.</p><p>Specifically, in April of 2018, at the age of 18 years and 307 days, Kai reached 50 Bundesliga appearances becoming the youngest player ever, overtaking <a href=# rel=noopener>Timo Werner</a>, who previously held the record.</p><p>In this campaign, Havertz netted three goals with 30 appearances. Regardless of his fifth-place finish, the German star decided to play for the club for a few more years.</p><p>With the contract extension that binded him until 2022, Havertz was also fulfilling his dream of playing in the Champions League.</p><p>At one point, the Leverkusen duo Julian Brandt and Kai Havertz were amongst the most feared attacking partnerships.</p><p>Eventually, Brandt moved onto Borussia Dortmund for the 2019/20 season; Kai stayed behind to help the club grow.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, the German national was on a streak of breaking records, as he yet again became the youngest Bundesliga player (19 at that time) to score a penalty in a 3-0 win against Wolfsburg.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same season, Kai was the only player in the Leverkusen squad to continually appear in the starting squad and had already netted six goals.</p><p>In the upcoming month, he became the youngest player to have 75 appearances, one step behind Julian Draxler in a game against Fortuna Dusseldorf.</p><p>Likewise, Havertz celebrated his 100th Bundesliga appearance with style as he came on to score one goal in a win against VfB Stuttgart, the goal being the only of the game.</p><p>On May 5, as Bayer thrashed Eintracht Frankfurt 6-1, Kai registered 15th for the campaign.</p><p>Even though that game was a memorable one for the teenager, the attacking midfielder became the highest-scoring teenager with 17 goals that came against a weakened Hertha&nbsp;BSC.&nbsp;</p><h3>Last Stint At Bayer Leverkusen And Journey To Chelsea&nbsp;</h3><p>Kai’s importance for the upheaval of Bayer Leverkusen was phenomenal. Never has anyone seen such a brilliant player that can give so much in the game.</p><p>At the end of the 2018/19 campaign, Havertz finished second in the German Player of the Year behind Marco Reus.</p><p>However, we had yet to witness his last glorious run blazing the Bundesliga in the 2019/20 season.</p><p>One of the most brilliant performances came in the Champions League game against Juventus and Atletico Madrid.</p><p>Notwithstanding the eventual loss to the group stage’s favorites, the German midfielder’s performance was highly commendable.</p><p>Setting up Moussa Diaby, Kevin Volland, and Leon Bailey, Leverkusen pressurized the opponents with Kai’s indescribable contribution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/235828676_782343339129660_8436131055335738958_n.jpg><p>Bayer Leverkusen was fighting for the Champions League spot as the Bundesliga was seeing its most competitive season in the 2019/20 season.&nbsp;</p><p>With the likes of Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig always challenging league leaders and defending champions, Bayern Munich, and Bayer Leverkusen, weren’t far behind.</p><p>On March 7, 2020, Bayer Leverkusen thrashed Frankfurt 4-0, as Havertz recorded one goal and one assist.</p><p>However, they could secure the title, and on 4 September 2020, he was sold to Chelsea.&nbsp;</p><p>Kai managed to score nine goals and eight assists in 45 games in his first season at Chelsea.</p><p>The club won the 2021 UEFA Champions League on 29 May 2021, and he scored the only goal of the game to beat Manchester City.&nbsp;</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>In particular, the German became an international player with the U-16 squad, making his debut on November 11, 2014, as a substitute for Tom Baack.</p><p>Kai made it to the roster for UEFA European U-17 Championship in 2016.</p><p>Germany went onto play for five matches until Spain eliminated them in the semi-finals. Thereafter, a personal situation prevented Havertz from participating in other youth international competitions for 15 months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/286164980_1160690388047129_6403894118917817430_n.jpg><p>Finally, played against Switzerland in the U-19 competition in August 2017.</p><p>On the other hand, Kai registered his first international goal with poker in a 5-1 win against Belarus, eventually leading him to captain the U-19 side in the upcoming matches.</p><p>Moreover, Kai’s wait was over, as on August 29, 2018, Germany head coach <a href=# rel=noopener>Joachim Low</a> included him in the roster for the UEFA Nations League.</p><p>With his debut, Havertz became the first player to be born in the year 1999 and represent the national team.</p><p>Furthermore, he also represented Germany at UEFA Euro 2020 and the 2022 FIFA World Cup.</p><h2>Injury History&nbsp;</h2><p>Although a player has higher ratings and even legends and pundits remark him/her as a generational talent, no player can foresee and prevent injury; it’s just part of the game.</p><p>Havertz, still a young and blooming player, hit an injury phase. It did not look good on his resume; however, Kai just took it as a minor setback to bounce back stronger.</p><p>For instance, in the 2017/2018 season, the German encountered problems on his knees. As a result, Havertz remained on the sidelines from August 14 to August 24, 2017, missing only one game.</p><p>Similarly, in the 2018/2019 season, a bruise on the knee saw the attacking midfielder sidelined for 11 days from October 8, 2018. Fortunately, he didn’t miss much action as the international break was ongoing.</p><p>Again, the German missed one of the Leverkusen fixtures due to a mild illness that cost him one match appearance on October 24, 2019.</p><p>In the same season, a torn muscle fiber during the 2019/20 season saw Havertz miss two Bundesliga matches on November 11, 2019, which ruled him out for 17 days.</p><p>Nonetheless, after successful medical assistance, Kai got back to the training grounds to work on his comeback.</p><p>Likewise, in May 2022, he was ruled out of Chelsea’s FA Cup final due to a hamstring injury against Liverpool.&nbsp;</p><p>As of late, Havertz is working his best to win Champions League, and all we can hope for is his better health and form.</p><h2>Career Achievements</h2><p>A pride for Bayer Leverkusen, Chelsea, and Germany, there is no doubt that the collection of accolades will only grow with time.</p><p>Some of his accolades are given below:</p><ul><li>UEFA Champions League: 2020–21</li><li>UEFA Super Cup: 2021</li><li>FIFA Club World Cup: 2021</li><li>Bundesliga Player of the Month (April & May 2019)</li><li>Bundesliga Team of the Year: 2018/2019</li><li>UEFA Champions League Breakthrough XI: 2019</li><li>Fritz Walter Medal U-17 (Silver): 2016</li><li>Fritz Walter Medal U-19: 2018</li></ul><h2>Salary, Net Worth & Transfer Market&nbsp;</h2><p>Reports suggest that Kai Havertz has a staggering net worth of <strong>$2 million</strong> as of December 2023.</p><p>The Bundesliga wonder kid received a hefty salary of $32,000 per week at Bayer Leverkusen, which was a significant sum considering the attacking midfielder’s age.</p><p>With the renewal of the contract at <span id=Bayer_Leverkusen class=mw-headline>Bayer Leverkusen, he</span> earned $2.1 million every year as a salary.</p><p>Top clubs in Europe and even in Germany were eyeing to buy out Kai as Leverkusen labeled an approximately $156 million price tag on the youngster.</p><p>He chose to join Chelsea in 2020 and earned a huge amount as he initially received $74 million with the Chelsea contract, which later on raised to $85.5 million.</p><p>However, his future in Chelsea is in a dilemma as they are willing to sell him for around $65 million to generate money to buy a new player.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Premier League clubs like Liverpool, Manchester United, and La Liga giants Barcelona are eager to jump in to recruit the 24 year old.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the transfermarkt website, as of December 2023, Kai enjoys a career-high market value of $74.58 million, granted that the youngster started from the $106K market value.&nbsp;</p><p>In like manner, he earns a considerable sum from the sporting brand Nike, Caprison juice, and Calvin Klein, which adds to his growing fortune.</p><p>Nonetheless, at present, he is working hard to maintain his position in Chelsea and is paving the way to newer opportunities.</p><h2>Kai Havertz Personal Life&nbsp;</h2><p>In particular, the attacking midfielder has a girlfriend named Sophia Weber, who is a model.</p><p>There is no information on how the couple met, but they aren’t shy to pour love on social media. On July 22, 2022, Kai posted their photo and wished her a happy four-year anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>Sophia is based in London and celebrates her birthday on May 28, 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/321323523_720461165954538_320773296930436145_n.jpg><p>Despite having little details on Sophia, we can safely say that she and Kai make a beautiful pair.</p><p>Moreover, they are parents to three dogs, which they love and adore.&nbsp;</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>The soccer player is quiet popular on social media, where he shares pictures of his girlfriend, dogs, and his career.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Instagram:</strong> 5.3M Followers</p><p><strong>Twitter:</strong> 1.5M Followers</p><p><strong>Facebook:</strong> 5.8M Followers</p><h2>Popularity Graph&nbsp;</h2><p>Kai Havertz is a renowned athlete who has been the subject of millions of searches on the internet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kai-Habertz-Search-Graph-2023-Source-Google-Trend.png><p>The above data represent his search results for the past 12 months.&nbsp;</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</h2><h3>Which was Kai Havertz's disallowed goal?</h3><p>In a match played in March 2021, Kai had a disallowed goal.
