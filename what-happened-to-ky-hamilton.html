Following the injury, Dr. Tandy Freeman, the Medical Director of the Justin Sportsmedicine team, explained what had happened.</p><p>"Ky and the bull smacked heads against one another," Dr. Freeman explained. "He lost consciousness and has a concussion. He was sent to University Medical Center Trauma Center (in Las Vegas) for evaluation and observation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The doctor also said that Ky would definitely miss round 6 of the competition, which was scheduled for 10 a.m. on Dec. 13, and would be reevaluated for round 7, which is scheduled for 5:45 p.m. Freeman did say that fans should not get their hopes up, though. "He's doubtful for competition (Wednesday) evening," Freeman said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ky was having a great tournament prior to the injury.</h2><p>Before he was concussed, Ky was having the best National Finals of his career to date. He won two rounds of the NFR, and posted 89 points during a ride on Bridwell Pro Rodeos' Fred. He has already earned $147,849 at this year's NFR, and he's also first in the PRCA | RAM World Standings with $402,013.

His father's side of the family was into bull riding, according to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro Rodeo bio</a>, and he has cousins who ride bulls and bareback horses in Australia. Ky started riding steers at age 12, and competed for the first time in America when he was just 15 at the Junior High School Finals in Des Moines, Iowa.</p><p>Fans of Ky's posted comments on Instagram with their prayers, saying that they hope he's okay and ultimately able to resume competition.</p><p>"That was one of the craziest buck offs ive seen, sending prayers ur way Ky, no matter what please remember to take care of yourself and heal. God bless," one person wrote.</p><p>It's unclear when Ky will be back to competing, but at least for now, it seems he's focused on his recovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSksV2drq61y62mpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./c7chgl2ocb6e-oqqulragncqtlalob-k.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Acapulco Shore Season 7 Episode 10: &amp;quot;Verga Muerta&amp;quot;</span></a>
