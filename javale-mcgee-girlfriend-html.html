However, there are still things that his fans may not know about his personal life, especially about having a possible wife or partner.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 id=Does+JaVale+McGee+Have+a+Wife+ name=Does+JaVale+McGee+Have+a+Wife+>Does JaVale McGee Have a Wife?</h2><p>Is JaVale McGee married? Well, his fatherhood makes many questions if&nbsp;he is married and has a wife.</p><p>But the basketball player has never mentioned having a wife. Instead, he has only been open about his long-term relationship with partner&nbsp;Giselle Ramirez.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>JaVale McGee with his possible wife, Giselle Ramirez. </strong>(Photo:&nbsp;Giselle Ramirez/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Although the details of how and when McGee and his partner started dating are yet to be public knowledge, they have been together since, at least, 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>It is so because the pair welcomed their first child, daughter&nbsp;Genevieve Grey McGee, on November 3, 2016. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 id=JaVale+McGee+Has+a+Daughter+with+Giselle+Ramirez name=JaVale+McGee+Has+a+Daughter+with+Giselle+Ramirez>JaVale McGee Expecting New Baby with Giselle Ramirez</h2><p>Since their daughter's arrival, both McGee and his girlfriend have kept their fans in the loop regarding their parenthood through social media, comedy videos,&nbsp;or interviews.</p><p>"When I'm with her, we eat healthy," McGee stated in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Orange County</a> Register in November 2018. The 33-year-old gushed about fatherhood and shared how he was trying his best to instill good habits in his daughter.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In his own words, he had become&nbsp;conscious of his activities. He started watching his language and stopped eating junk foods around her. Not only that, but the&nbsp;Phoenix Suns star also spent time with his kid, running and strolling in the park.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"It's crazy, but that's a little human that I have to raise," McGee remarked before ending the conversation on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>Without a surprise, the basketball player considers fatherhood the best thing that happened in his life. On 2020 Father's Day, he posted a picture of himself with his daughter and dedicated a <a href=# rel="follow noopener">heart-warming message</a> to her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The Michigan native heralded his daughter as a beautiful, vibrant, charismatic, intelligent, curious, strong-willed, and hilarious young lady. He also shared he thanked God every day for having an opportunity to raise a queen.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He even mentioned his father, George&nbsp;Montgomery, and expressed his gratitude for&nbsp;showing him "how to demand respect even without saying a word."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Interestingly, McGee's fatherhood bliss is getting doubled as he is expecting his second child with his partner.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>While he didn't give away the pregnancy news, his partner announced it through her Instagram on 2022 Valentine's Day. She posted a picture of her baby bump and wrote, "Happy Valentine's Day, love birds!"</p><p>In the caption, she revealed she was less than three months away from welcoming their second baby. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 id=Who+Is+JaVale+McGee+s+Girlfriend+ name=Who+Is+JaVale+McGee+s+Girlfriend+>Who Is JaVale McGee's Girlfriend?</h2><p>McGee's girlfriend Ramirez is a sport and entertainment&nbsp;realtor based in&nbsp;Beverly Hills & Los Angeles County.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Family time: JaVale McGee with his baby mama and daughter Genevieve Grey McGee.</strong>&nbsp;(Photo:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her professional bio in<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Zillow</a> reveals she specializes in properties throughout Los Angeles County.&nbsp;</p><p>The mother-of-one earned her double degrees from the University of&nbsp;California, Los Angeles.
