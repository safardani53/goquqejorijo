Amazon Prime members might want to considered checking out what <a href=#>Prime Gaming</a> has to offer.</p><p>For those not in the know, Prime Gaming is <a href=#>Amazon</a>'s gaming streaming platform which gives user monthly free games, in-game content, and other benefits. In addition to Prime Gaming, there's also Amazon Luna which widens the catalog of games and <a href=#>subscriptions</a> available to Amazon Prime gamers.</p><p>While Prime Gaming can be seen as the base package for games on Amazon, Luna and the subsequent Luna Games catalogs open players up a wider range of gaming options at the cost of additional subscriptions. While Prime Gaming offers a strong basics catalog with currently Fall Guys, Madden 23, and in-game content for free-to-play games like Apex Legends and Pokémon GO, Luna with Prime Gaming offers specific catalogs the likes of Ubisoft+, Luna+, and the Retro gaming channel.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Prime Gaming</span></figure><p>Outside of streaming games, Prime Gaming also gives Amazon gamers other benefits. In addition to free extras and cosmetics in free-to-play games like Apex Legends and Valorant, Prime Gaming also provides Twitch viewers with one free <a href=#>Twitch</a> subscription to be used for a Twitch affiliated channel.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Prime Gaming free with Amazon Prime?</h2><p>Naturally, the question arise as to whether or not Prime Gaming is included with an Amazon Prime account. While Amazon Prime members won't be able to enjoy the full package of what Prime Gaming with Luna has to offer, they can at the very least get the basics.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Prime Gaming</span></figure><p>Starting with the free Amazon trial, even gamers who haven't made the commitment to an Amazon Prime subscription can at least try out Prime Gaming. Amazon Prime trial users have access to Prime Gaming for 30 days and maybe can even get one month of a free Twitch subscription out of the trial.</p><p>Standard Prime members will get access to the basic Prime Gaming plan along with Prime Student accounts. Video-only Prime members will get some of the benefits of Prime Gaming like a free Twitch channel sub but won't be eligible for free channel subscriptions.</p><p>As far as games to play on Prime Gaming, some of the highlights are Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Metro Exodus, Earthworm Jim 2, and Skatebird.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvNGipJ5ll5a6qrrGZp2rnZVixKrAx2aYppmqpLtuvNGipJ4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenna-ortega-parents-siblings-html.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Jenna Ortegas Big Family Life with Her Parents and Five Siblings</span></a>
