I think we should play strip dodgeball," Crawley told the men.</p><p>The blue team lost in straight sets and were forced to walk home naked, but not before Clare hugged each of them in a moment that one viewer on Twitter described as "very sexual harrassy."</p><p>Many fans — or former fans, as the case may be — were outraged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Several pointed out that if a male Bachelor asked his female contestants to strip down on camera, a producer likely would have stepped in and put a stop to the scene.</p><p>“I realize this ‘date’ is gonna have a lot of critics, but can you imagine the flak the show would get if this was #Thebachelor and the girls were stripping down to their underwear? #sexist," one Twitter user wrote.</p><p>“Can you imagine if The Bachelor made a bunch of women play strip dodgeball? He’d get canceled immediately,” another added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“If women on the bachelor were asked to play strip dodge ball it would be a riot. #Bachelorette," a third chimed.</p><p>Some even went so far as to compare Clare to the franchise’s most notorious villains.</p><p>“Imagine the outrage if Juan Pablo asked the girls to do strip dodgeball….and said ‘sorry girls, my game my rules’ Why does Clare get a pass? This is cringeworthy TV," one viewer tweeted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>“So Clare on the #bachelorette, makes many of the men strip down.. Could you imagine the scrutiny a ‘bachelor’ would get if he wanted girls to strip down? Then continues to hug the naked guys.. super classy," another wrote.</p><p>“I’m honestly grossed out by this. This would NEVER happen the other way around with women playing ‘strip dodgeball,’ so they shouldn’t make the men do it either. Not a good look," yet another pointed out.</p><p>Yeah, we would say regardless of gender, pressuring virtual strangers to take their clothes off on national TV is not a good look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Clare seemed to think this was a moment of empowered feminism, but the fact is, even though no one voiced an objection, several of the men were visibly uncomfortable, and&nbsp;Brendan Morais refused to remove his jock strap.</p><p>Only the much-maligned <a href=#>Yosef Aborady</a> — who was not on hand for the game — later pointed out that Clare’s demands were highly inappropriate.</p><p>We understand that this is the quarantine season, and producers have limited options in terms of activities, but given the number of experienced professionals on hand, someone should have stepped in and pointed out that compelled stripping will always come off as more than a little gross.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Bachelorette Spoilers: When Tayshia Takes Over …</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z9cK%2FLmqmeZZOnrri4xLJkmpuTqsCmsIyonWarla3CoriMoZirmaOouqa602adqKScpMSqusZmqq2qmaV6pbvDoJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./biannca-prince.html><span>←</span><span>Biannca Prince Biography, Wiki, Age, Parents, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
