The controversial celebrity blogger is facing backlash over comments he made on <a href=#>Charli D’Amelio</a>’s TikTok account, which has over 34.5 million followers.&nbsp;</p><p>The 41-year-old called out the social media star for dancing in a bikini on her page, and later posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> centered around her father’s 2014 drunk driving arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, fans of <a href=#>Hype House</a> — a content creator collective that includes Charli — wanted to know why the gossip columnist zeroed in on the teen and her family. Apparently, he loves mixing it up with Gen Z.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Perez Hilton and Charli D’Amelio’s feud is seemingly one-sided.</h2><p>The drama began after Charli posted a video from her vacation to the Bahamas with several other influencers. In the clip, the bathing suit-clad beauty shakes her hips to "Sugar" by the alt hip hop band BROCKHAMPTON.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@charlidamelio href=#>@charlidamelio</a><p>@avani</p><a title="♬ sugar by brockhampton but with a surprise - adamohmusic" href=#>♬ sugar by brockhampton but with a surprise - adamohmusic</a></figure><p>"Anyone else think it's inappropriate for a 15-year-old to dance to this?" Perez, who’s a dad to three kids under the age of 8, wrote in the comments section. Charli replied, "i'm sorry i'm just trying to have fun! :)," to which the Florida native responded, "I wish I looked that good in a bikini at 15!"</p><p>The high schooler later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to Twitter</a> to defend herself after being criticized over her choice of swimwear. "i will continue to post when i feel happy and confident so if me wearing a swimsuit at the beach is a problem well sucks to suck doesn’t it," she wrote on March 4.</p><p>When one supporter tweeted, "Imagine coming after a 15 year old trying to have fun" with a pair of clown emojis, Perez maintained, "I didn’t come after her. I <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned her parents’</a> decisions."</p><p>That caused another Charli follower to remark, "maybe you should question your decisions bro. She was just doing her thing, you’re the [weirdo] who was thinking gross things." A third Twitter user added, "why is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">perez hilton obsessed</a> with charli like leave her alone u weirdo."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Sadly, this isn’t the first time Charli has had to contend with unsolicited opinions from much older men. In January, fellow TikTok personality Curtis Newbill made a sexual joke about the young dancer in <a href=#>a diss track</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"These grown men thinking it’s funny to say inappropriate things and make fun of a fifteen year old are disrespectful and pathetic," Charli said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in response</a> to the 24-year-old’s lyrics. "i have feelings. most of these people are ADULT MEN, grow up and stop sexualizing teens it’s not funny it’s gross!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Perez went after Charli D’Amelio’s father following his TikTok fiasco.</h2><p>The "TMI: My Life in Scandal" author doubled down on his scrutiny of Charli’s behavior in a minute-long YouTube video, but clarified that his "real issue" is with her parents, Marc and Heidi D'Amelio.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Why did the dad and the mom leave that video up?" he questioned in a TikTok compilation. "I would’ve made my daughter take it down." Perez then insinuated that Marc's previous arrest for drunk driving demonstrates a lack of good judgment in the family.</p><p>"This dude <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drove drunk</a> with his daughter in the car!" he shared, referring to reports that a then 9-year-old Charli was involved in the incident. "This explains so much."</p><p>Neither Charli nor Marc have responded publicly to Perez’s video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbKzsdlmn6KkpKS7bq3NnWScoJGnuap5w5qknqSZpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-jinger-duggar-move-to-la.html><span>←</span><span>Jinger Duggar and Jeremy Vuolo Have a New Home Far Away From Her Family</span></a>
