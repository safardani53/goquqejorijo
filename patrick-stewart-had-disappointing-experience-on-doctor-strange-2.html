They were shot on their own. It was frustrating and disappointing but that’s how it has been. The last few years have been challenging.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Stewart appeared as his X-Men character for a surprise cameo in the 2022 sequel. <strong>Benedict Cumberbatch’s</strong> Doctor Strange appeals to the Illuminati, which consists of Charles Xavier, Mr. Fantastic (<strong>John Krasinski</strong>), Captain Marvel (<strong>Lashana Lynch</strong>) and Captain Britain (<strong>Hayley Atwell</strong>), for assistance until the grief-stricken Scarlet Witch (<strong>Elizabeth Olsen</strong>) kills them all one by one.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Marvel film, directed by</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;<strong>Sam Raimi</strong>, took a darker approach to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it follows Steven Strange and America Chavez (<strong>Xochitl Gomez</strong>) as they attempt to save the multiverse. The superhero flick marked the first time a member of the X-Men series was featured in the MCU thanks to Disney’s acquisition of Fox, setting the stage for mutants to make an introduction in the future.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Now, Stewart may be gearing up to bring Xavier back into the Marvel franchise for a second time with Deadpool 3, which is set to premiere in July as the only MCU movie hitting theaters this year. The Star Trek actor told host <strong>Josh Horowitz</strong> on Wednesday that there may be some footing behind the rumors of a potential cameo.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It has come up,” Stewart said, noting that the logistics have been a “process” due to various contributing obstacles. “The last two or three years have been so difficult with the labor problems and the health problems and Covid,” he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Stewart wouldn’t be the only familiar face from past X-Men films showing up in Deadpool’s third installment. <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>, who stars as the title character and serves as producer, announced in September 2022 that longtime pal <strong>Hugh Jackman</strong> will reprise his role as Wolverine, despite the actor previously claiming he’d retired his claws for good after 2017’s&nbsp;Logan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Patrick-Stewart-Had-Disappointing-Experience-on-Doctor-Strange-2-4.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It’s not like adding Hugh Jackman to a movie like this is a hard sell. It’s an immediate and emphatic, unqualified yes,” Reynolds told <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> in November 2022. “It’s a lot of moving parts and Fox and X-Men and all that kind of stuff that Marvel needs to sort through. A lot of red tape in order to make that happen. And they did it.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Wolverine technically met his fate at the end of Logan, Reynolds, 47, previously revealed that Deadpool plans to bring the character back without disrespecting the stories that came before.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“We’ve figured out a way to do it that’s Hugh Jackman-approved and <strong>Kevin Feige</strong>-approved where we’re completely protecting the legacy of Logan the way it was left off,” Reynolds said during a November 2022 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. “I wouldn’t mess with that. I’m really excited.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Bringing back deceased characters in the superhero world isn’t uncommon.
