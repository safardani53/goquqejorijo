Now, check out these boots and imagine how cute you’d look in them while posing for pictures:</p><h2>1. Steve Madden Tava Over the Knee Boot</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>We’re starting this list with a classic pair of suede, over-the-knee boots from Steve Madden. These boots are extra tall so you won’t have to worry about them bunching up around your knees. You’ll be extra taller, too, thanks to the boots’ 3 1/2 inch high heel. Shoppers raved over these boots, with many noting how they are “obsessed” and they have an “Amazing fit!” $70, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>nordstrom.com</a></p><h2><a href=# rel=nofollow><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/68aa3a05-fba1-4334-ab69-82fcb8da08f1.webp alt=boots width=487 height=523 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">N.N.G’s Winter Over Knee Long Boots</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>These boots are a No. 1 best-seller on Amazon, with more than 3,600 reviews and a 4.5-star rating. We put these boots on the list because they have&nbsp;structure. We get how frustrating it can be when your over-the-knee boots keep falling down, which defeats the whole purpose of buying boots this tall in the first place. Many reviewers happily noted that these boots, which come with a two-inch heel, actually stay put. “I have thin legs and this is the only boot I’ve ever owned that actually stays up,” one customer wrote, while another commented, “They also dont go down my legs as I walk which was initially my concern since they dont have laces that I can tighten at the back.” These great Stuart Weitzman alternatives are available in sizes 5.5-10, and are currently six percent off on Amazon. $50, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-2.44.05-PM.png alt="over the knee boots" width=346 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>3. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Mtzyoa’s Thigh High Block Heel Boot</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Now, let’s switch it up a little by adding a pair of brown boots to this list. Well, these are technically taupe, but come in many colors like pink, grey, hot red and nude too. These over-the-knee boots are so long, they reach up to your thighs — perfect to wear with a mini skirt or extra short dress, or even an oversized T-shirt. More than 2,100 customers left reviews on Amazon for these boots, with many raving over the suede material and fit of these shoes. “The quality is excellent,” one reviewer noted, while others commended the boots for being “buttery soft” and “comfortable.” They also loved the heels on the boots, which stand at a modest height between two-three inches. These boots are available in sizes 5.5-10. $50, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-2.57.36-PM.png alt="over the knee boots" width=404 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>4. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">DREAM PAIRS Suede Over The Knee Thigh High Boots</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>For our readers who prioritize comfort first, here are a pair of boots with no heels at all. This suede pair from DREAM PAIRS even has a drawstring on the back, just like the original pair of Stuart Weitzman over-the-knee boots do. The stretchy material means you can wear these boots up to your thighs, and scrunch them down if you feel like switching up your look. More than 2,500 customers reviewed these boots on Amazon, leaving compliments like how these boots are “SO comfortable,”&nbsp; the drawstring helps “keep the boots from falling down,” and the shoes are “true to size.” Speaking of the fit, these boots are available in sizes 5-11. While the boots below are gray, they also come in black, blue, brown and khaki. $53, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-13><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-3.09.38-PM.png alt="over the knee boots" width=233 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Cape Robbin Kelsey-21 Cowboy Boots</span></h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Over-the-knee boots don’t need to be just one solid color. If you’re looking for boots with a little extra flair, we’re obsessed with this pair from Cape Robbin. The cowgirl-inspired print and bold style is sassy, unique, yet still on-trend. Pair these one-of-a-kind boots with daisy dukes or an oversized neutral tone tee to look like you just walked out of a Vogue magazine. You really can have fun with these western boots, because they come in all kinds of colors: black, white, baby blue, stone, multi, denim and terracotta. If you’re nervous about trying out such standout boots, don’t be: over 2,000 people reviewed these boots on Amazon and left an average rating of 4.6 stars out of five stars. $60, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-16><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-3.25.42-PM.png alt="over the knee boots" width=278 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2>6. UGG Over-The-Knee Boots</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>We’re ending this list with something a bit more experimental: over-the-knee UGG boots. You read that right. These suede boots will keep your feet and legs warm all winter long with ultra-cozy, 100 percent wool lining inside. There’s also no heel, which only maximizes the comfort level of these UGG shoes. Given that these are UGG boots, they’re a bit more on the pricier side, but still less than half the price of Stuart Weitzman’s classic “The Lowland Boot,” which retails for $798. These boots are available in sizes 5-12.&nbsp;$180, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>amazon.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-18><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-17-at-3.17.12-PM.png alt="over the knee boots" width=260 height=515 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-19>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGiqoaegZLy3sdFmq6GdXaC7prGMm6aorKNiwLXBwKurZq%2BVnsG7ucCnZJqkpJq%2Fr63Toq2eq11pf3mCj3JtaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-jessica-parker-son-shares-rare-family-thanksgiving-selfie-8407318.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Jessica Parker's Son Shares Rare Family Thanksgiving Photo</span></a>
