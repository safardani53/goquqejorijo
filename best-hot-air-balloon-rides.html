The Champagne and Breakfast package goes a step further and includes a full a la carte and continental breakfast for an extra £30.</p><p>With both of these packages, you'll be joined by a small group of people (the balloon's capacity is 10-16 passengers). But, the basket is split into four compartments to ensure you have plenty of space.</p><p>If you really want to impress someone — whether it's for a romantic proposal, an important celebration or a corporate event — and you'd rather a private balloon flight, these are available from £1,290.</p><p><strong>Number of launch sites</strong>: 1; <strong>Time in the air</strong>: Unspecified; <strong>Voucher validity</strong>: Unspecified months; <strong>Price</strong>: From £129 per person</p><h2>How much is a hot air balloon ride?</h2><p>Hot air balloon rides can vary in price depending on which company you use, what time of the day and what day of the week you travel and what’s included in the experience.</p><p>In the UK, they typically start from £124 but can go up to a couple of hundred pounds for packages. You could spend thousands on a luxury ride, though. For example, Crazy Bear's private balloon ride package starts at £1,290.</p><h2>Where to buy hot air balloon experiences</h2><p>You can buy hot air balloon experiences from a range of different companies, including:</p><h2>How long is a hot air balloon ride?</h2><p>The length of the hot air balloon ride will vary from company to company but typically you’re in the air for around 60 minutes. It can however vary depending on the weather.</p><p>The whole experience can last for upwards of four hours, including safety briefing and time to take photos.</p><h2>How do hot air balloons work?</h2><p>Hot air balloons are essentially just wicker baskets attached to a parachute (balloon) with burners inside it. Hot air rises, and by heating the air inside the balloon with burners, it becomes lighter than the cool air on the outside and the balloon then floats upwards.</p><p>To steer and land the balloon, the pilot has to manipulate the temperature of the air and catch different air streams and different heights.</p><h2>Are hot air balloon flights safe?</h2><p>Like all modes of transport, you'll always hear horror stories about accidents and safety concerns. However, according to the Aviation Accident Database put out by the FAA, hot air ballooning is actually the safest form of air travel. There are rarely any aviation crashes involving hot air balloons.</p><p>This is partly down to the fact that all hot air balloon flights in the UK are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, so there are regulations to do with safety, insurance, training and licensing. All equipment must be regularly checked and maintained, and all pilots must be thoroughly trained.</p><p>The main safety concern regarding hot air ballooning is weather. However, your flight will be cancelled if the conditions are unsafe and pilots will only fly if winds are below 10mph and there's good visibility. If your flight is cancelled, you'll usually be able to rebook within a certain timeframe.</p><h2>How high do hot air balloons go?</h2><p>The highest a hot air balloon has flown is 22,000 feet. However, to fly this high, you'd need oxygen and special gear.</p><p>On regular hot air balloon flights and experience days, your hot air balloon will go anywhere between 2,000 and 5,000 feet.</p><p>Specifically how high you'll fly depends on where you are, the weather conditions, and the time of year.</p><h2>What to wear for hot air balloon rides</h2><p>Wrap up warm! The hot air balloon season runs from March to October in the UK and most rides are either morning or evening, which means it can get cold, especially up in the air.</p><p>Make sure you have warm, comfortable clothes that are suitable for the outdoors, even if it rains or gets muddy.</p><p>You may also want to bring a hat as well, but make sure it’s not one that will be easily blown away.</p><p>As for shoes, anything flat, sturdy and comfortable is good, like trainers you don’t mind getting muddy.</p><h2>How many people can ride in a hot air balloon?</h2><p>The number of people on a commercial hot air balloon ride will depend on the size of the balloon and the size of the baskets, as well as of course how many people book the experience.</p><p>On the smaller end it can be six to eight people, but it can also be as many as 20.</p><h2>Who invented the hot air balloon?</h2><p>The hot air balloon was invented in 1783 by two brothers, Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier from Annonay in France.</p><p>Their first version, which they demonstrated in public in June that year, was made using cloth and paper, with heat coming from a straw fire to lift the balloon. It, like several versions that came after it, was unmanned.</p><p>But in just a few months, they created a version that was big and strong enough to carry people.</p><p>Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent, marquis d’Arlandes, then became the first people to go on a manned hot air balloon in the November of that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZm5qZ2x%2FdYOOm5ysrF2dvLV5wKKpZpqRobmwu81mqaKclah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-lilan-bowden-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Lilan Bowden Dating Now</span></a>
