The series lasted for four seasons starting in 2005 and probably would’ve lasted longer if <a href=#>certain circumstances</a> hadn’t come into play.</p><p>But quite a bit has changed for the cast since we last saw them together — for starters, they're all grown up! Now, the entire PCA gang is back together for the reunion viewers they didn't know they needed. Read on for details on the Zoey 102 reboot! Plus, an update on what the original cast is up to today!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A Parmount Plus reboot of 'Zoey 101' is OTW — here's everything we know about 'Zoey 102' so far!</h2><p>Paramount Plus <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released a trailer</a> for the Zoey 101 reboot — Zoey 102 — in mid-June of 2023. The news comes as a surprise to fans of the series, who never really asked for it. However, a good look at the trailer reminds us why we fell in love with the show in the first place.</p><p>The network also confirmed that the cast is heading to a small screen near you much sooner than you'd think. In fact, the official release date for Zoey 102 is July 7. Needless to say, the anticipation is real.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The first teaser for ‘ZOEY 102’ has been released.</p><p>The film releases on July 27 on Paramount+ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jLriFCZ3hn</a></p>— DiscussingFilm (@DiscussingFilm) <a href=#>June 20, 2023</a></figure><p>Among the stars returning for the reboot are Jamie's on-screen ex-boyfriend Sean Flynn and Erin Sanders, who played Quinn Pensky.

But what is the original cast up to IRL these days? Read on to find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jamie Lynn Spears</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Getty Images</span></figure><p>There has been a lot of negative press surrounding Jamie Lynn Spears in the last decade or so because of everything that was going on with her older sister, <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>. When Britney's conservatorship came to an end, a lot of her devoted fans had questions. One thing being asked about was whether or not Jamie Lynn was being a supportive sister to Britney through the entire ordeal.</p><p>A lot of the drama is actively ongoing which means there aren’t any clear answers just yet. As of now, Jamie Lynn is focused on <a href=#>continuing her role</a> on Netflix's <a href=#>Sweet Magnolias</a> and handling motherhood. She has two kids named Maddie Briann Aldridge and Ivey Joan Watson.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Victoria Justice</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Getty Images</span></figure><p>After playing Lola Martinez on Zoey 101, <a href=#>Victoria Justice</a> went on to land the leading role on another Nickelodeon show called Victorious. She's also starred in a few recent projects including The Afterlife of the Party and Trust. Along with acting, music is another huge focus in Victoria’s life.</p><p>In 2020 she released a song called “Treat Myself" on YouTube that’s racked in more than 4.6 million views so far. Rumors about drama between Victoria and her former co-star <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a> made their rounds for quite some time, but as of today it seems the two beauties are on friendlier terms.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sean Flynn</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Instagram/@rioflynn</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Flynn</a> played Chase Matthews on Zoey 101. For those who might’ve forgotten, Chase was Zoey's greatest love interest throughout the course of the show. Since the series ended, he’s appeared in other projects including The Last of Robin Hood and Devious Maids. He also landed a position as a producer at an entertainment company and got engaged to a woman named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyndsey Monconduit</a> in 2020.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christopher Massey</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Instagram/@chrismasseytmb</span></figure><p>It’s obvious that Zoey 101 wasn’t going to be the only show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Massey</a> — who played Michael Barret — would be part of in his career. He went on to land parts in shows like Switched at Birth and Accountable. He’s also heavily focused on being a family man lately. He has a daughter named Mariah with a woman named Cassalei Jackson. He also shares two kids named Bella and Carter with Bria Miller.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Matthew Underwood</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Instagram/@MattUnderwood</span></figure><p>Although he played the antagonist Logan Reese on Zoey 101 onscreen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Underwood</a> is a lot more likable in real life! He transitioned from acting to filmmaking after the show ended. According to his Instagram, he is very much interested in promoting brand deals and hanging out with his friends.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Erin Sanders</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Instagram/@ErinSanders</span></figure><p>The actress who took on the quirky and dorky role of Quinn Pensky on Zoey 101 is none other than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Sanders</a>. After her time on the show, she landed parts in other projects including Big Time Rush and Melissa & Joey. As far as her relationship status goes, she is totally taken. She’s dating a man named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Johan</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alexa Nikolas</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nickelodeon; Instagram/@matchthesource</span></figure><p>A lot has happened in the life of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexa Nikolas</a> — who played Nicole Bristow — since Zoey 101 came to an end. Rumors about a feud between her and Jamie Lynn made headlines, but what’s even worse is the allegations she made against her ex-husband. She was married to a man named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mike Milosh</a> from 2012 to 2019, and went on to accuse him of grooming and sexually abusing her. She hasn’t had an onscreen role since 2013, and she’s currently focused on raising her firstborn child with her new husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Gray</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kristin Herrera</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Nickelodeon; Instagram/@ms_kris__</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Herrera</a> briefly played the role of Dana Cruz on Zoey 101 back in 2005 for the first season of the show. She didn’t stay on the lineup for long, but she's still one of the memorable faces from the OG cast. In 2016, she got engaged to Daniel Novak, and in 2021, she revealed she was pregnant with their first child. Keeping up with her on social media isn’t possible since her account is currently private.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paul Butcher</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Paramount Plus; Instagram/@paulbutcher</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Butcher</a> played the role of Zoey's adorable little brother Dustin on the hit Nickelodeon show. His most recent focuses seem to be in the worlds of music and social media. He released a single called “Freaky (Tus Manos)" in 2020, and picked up a massive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok following </a>over the last few years as well. As of today, he’s got 1 million fans checking in on him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfr7ymxYxqZ2plk5bAtXnNqK4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-lawrence-denies-rumor-liam-hemsworth-affair-miley-cyrus-flower-music-video-7553851.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Lawrence Shuts Down Rumor of Liam Hemsworth Affair: 'Not True'</span></a>
