The 43-year-old hottie is a devout Catholic. And she wants you to know.</p><p>Editors (especially on this show) can be shady sometimes when it comes to how they introduce the cast. We first see Meisha being a little over-the-top in a church. But given that her social media paints a similar picture, this is just her authentic self.</p><p>Being Catholic does not make Meisha unusual. There are about 1.3 billion Catholics on the planet. However, Meisha is a convert.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_02-1024x576.png><p>The vast majority of Catholics (around 90%) grew up in their religion. And a sizable majority of converts are simply other Christians (Protestants).</p><p>Meisha did not grow up with any particular religious affiliation. She was a TV journalist who led a somewhat glamorous lifestyle.</p><p>Then, over a decade ago, Meisha was vacuuming in her living room. She suddenly had a transformative spiritual experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/0510_b90_meisha.png><p>She shared that she had a vision of two suns and felt an intense pressure. Transformative spiritual experiences happen to people of various faiths, and she would not be the first to find a religion after this life-altering event.</p><p>In her case, Meisha said that she read a bible and decided to convert to Catholicism.</p><p>She left her former job. At the same time, she ended up leaving the dating world — as her fresh conversion left her reluctant to discuss anything else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0620_meishajohnson_01-1024x576.png><p>Meisha shared even more of her story with <a href=#>The Catholic Spirit‘s April issue</a>, in a story titled “Two Suns and a Demon.”</p><p>There, she described a road rage incident. A woman pursued her car and yelled at her “in another language in a horrible and scary tone.”</p><p>She wondered if her new attunement to Catholic beliefs had brought this on. “I think that upset evil (forces),” she speculated. Her description of this road rage incident painted the woman as a “demonic Karen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_04-1024x576.png><p>46-year-old Nicola is also Catholic. In Israel, that makes him part of a religious minority.</p><p>He does not come from a Catholic household, but his grandmother imparted these beliefs upon him ever since he was 6.</p><p>Nicola lives with his mother. It’s unclear whether she is not Catholic or whether she is simply not as devout as Nicola, though it is possible that he considers those to be the same thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_05-1024x576.png><p>Nicola shared in his premiere episode that there is a cultural expectation in his region to live at home until he marries.</p><p>And Nicola has never married.</p><p>Because of his extremely orthodox Catholic beliefs, he has therefore never had sex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_06-1024x576.png><p>Nicola told viewers about his background. His grandmother was a nun.</p><p>She taught him how to pray according to Catholic tradition and theology.</p><p>We have a lot of questions, like wondering what his parents thought of this. But it sounds like Nicola wouldn’t change a thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_07-1024x576.png><p>Both Meisha and Nicola credit their God for bringing them together at just the right time.</p><p>He sent her a somewhat random DM about her numerous religious posts. This was when she was still a relatively recent convert.</p><p>Apparently, he has been something of a mentor to her on her religious journey. And, over the years, they have decided that they wish to marry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_08-1024x576.png><p>Not everyone in Meisha’s life is totally onboard with her plans to fly to Israel and see if Nicola is right for her.</p><p>He’s a 46-year-old virgin. It’s not just concerns about their sexual compatibility. Being a supportive partner in a relationship is a skill. It takes time.</p><p>And Meisha and Nicola can’t just try marriage to see if it works. They’re hardcore Catholics. Neither of them consider divorce to be an option. (Yes, even though she has been divorced before)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/06/0618_meishajohnson_09-1024x576.png><p>Obviously, Meisha and Nicola will have a lot to deal with. The annulment question, their compatibility, and how he gets along with her two daughters will be very important.</p><p>But, as Meisha told her sister, she cannot imagine not marrying him. No matter how many trips she takes. So she currently plans on just one.</p><p>We have to wonder if she’s going to bring up demonic Karens as the season goes on.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WDcLnEoqqhmV2fvKm60qilZquYlr%2Bmv4yhnKtlk6S7t7HRrKCopl2pvG6vwK2fqKSZmLa0uYyvmJybpaK2r7OMr6CsoZ%2BjwG6tzZ1kmmWUmrqwusicZKSZopq7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./utjz0xcjyapfy37ut-ndp41zrumtf-ub.html><span>←</span><span>Stream live TV, Movies, Originals, News, and more</span></a>
