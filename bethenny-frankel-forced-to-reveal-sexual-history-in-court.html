"Actually you have to define boyfriend."</p><p>She’s not trying to be technical, she’s just trying to answer honestly within the best of her ability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/bethenny-frankel-grieves.png><p>"How many men have you been romantically involved with?" Jason’s attorney asked.</p><p>"Define romantically," Bethenny asks.</p><p>It may sound like she’s being difficult or technical, but she needed to understand if he meant that literally — asking about her literally falling in love.</p><p>He was not asking literally, as he then bluntly clarifies.</p><p>Jason’s attorney rephrases: "How many men have you had sex with?"</p><p>"I think three," Bethenny states.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/08/bethenny-frankel-lays-down-the-law-1024x511.png><p>Back in 2014, it was rumored that Bethenny was in a relationship with Warren Lichtenstein.</p><p>"He was at some point someone you had a sexual relationship with?" Jason’s attorney asks.</p><p>"Yes," Bethenny replies. "I have had sex with him."</p><p>No one likes divulging their sexual history in court, but it can be especially painful for celebrities whose divorces are widely reported.</p><p>She adds that she visited Warren in Aspen when Bryn was a baby, then hung out with him in an apartment when Bryn was older.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/03/bethenny-frankel-on-rhony-1024x1009.png><p>Bethenny also dated her financier, Michael Cerussi, from 2013 to 2015.</p><p>"I had read that Mac was expelled from college after a frat house rape," Jason’s attorney mentions.</p><p>"I don’t believe he was expelled," Bethenny replies. "And I believe it got dropped."</p><p>He was accused of sexual assault in 2000, and was never charged with a crime.</p><p>While false accusations of sexual assault are extremely rare, Bethenny obviously cannot and should not be held accountable for another man’s behavior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2019/01/bethenny-frankel-is-in-charge-1024x639.png><p>Then the conversation moves to her late ex, Dennis Shields, who passed last year.</p><p>"Did Dennis have an opioid addiction?" Jason’s attorney asks heartlessly.</p><p>"I don’t know," Bethenny answers.</p><p>The attorney asks: "Did you ever see Dennis take opioids?"</p><p>"No," she replies.</p><p>The grilling continues with: "Did he ever tell you he was taking opioids?"</p><p>"No," she replies again.</p><p>She also confirmes that Dennis proposed to her while he was still, technically speaking, married. We all knew that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/10/paul-bernon-for-emilys-list-743x1024.jpg><p>Bethenny also speaks of her boyfriend, Paul Bernon.</p><p>"So," Jason’s attorney accuses, she began dating him "less then a month after Dennis had died?"</p><p>"Maybe a month after," Bethenny acknowledges.</p><p>Bethenny adds that she introduced Paul to Bryn "maybe a couple months" later, and also that she had dated him briefly back in 2017.</p><p>Jason’s attorney observes that introducing Paul to Bryn so soon was a custody violation.</p><p>"Well, technically, yes," Bethenny confesses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>This agonizing custody battle will resume again in May.</p><p>Bethenny is seeking greater physical custody of her daughter, and wants ultimate decision-making authority.</p><p>She argues that Jason Hoppy’s years of cruel behavior amount to torture, bringing into question his judgment.</p><p>It is clear that she also wants for him to no longer be allowed to cut her off from contact with Bryn while he has custody.</p><a href=#><img width=500 height=500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg alt="The Hollywood Gossip" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>44 Beautiful Photos of Bethenny Frankel</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2WAcK7ErZ%2Bepp6ueqe%2BwKeinqRdm7yzr8SdZK2nXaeyt7HApWSsnaiqrq15x6Kqraeirnqquoycpq6qpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barbara-walters-through-the-years-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Barbara Walters Through the Years: Photos</span></a>
