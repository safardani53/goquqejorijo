The couple welcomed daughter Blayke, 9, in 2011. The TLC duo also became the parents to quintuplets Parker, Hazel, Ava, Riley and Olivia, now 5, in 2015.</p><p>Last June, Adam and Danielle told Us exclusively that <a href=#>they don’t anticipate conceiving additional children</a> after <a href=#>welcoming their six daughters</a>. “Shop’s closed,” Danielle said at the time. “It would be nice to have a little boy and carry on the Busby name here, but there won’t be any more children unless one day God put it on our hearts to adopt.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Outdaughtered-Adam-Busby-Says-He-Is-Definitely-Open-to-Adopting-More-Kids-With-Wife-Danielle-Busby-02.jpg><p>Adam also noted that they will remain “open-minded” to adoption while adding, “As far as her birthing any more children, no, that’s not going to happen.”</p><p>For now, Adam and Danielle are gearing up for the 5th season of their TLC series. The longtime loves revealed to Us exclusively that they shot some of the scenes from their phones due to the coronavirus pandemic’s stay-at-home orders.</p><p>“We just got a few episodes in, and then the coronavirus hit. All the crew had to leave, so we’re like, ‘What do we do?’” Adam explained. “Everybody’s stuck at home, so we’re like, ‘Man, I guess we’re going to have to try to rush these episodes to air just because everybody’s stuck at home anyway. There was a lot of interviews and stuff that we hadn’t shot yet for those three episodes.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued, “In the evening when the girls went to sleep, we had to set up an interview set in our living room and shoot that while the kids were sleeping. We completely shot an entire episode, just our events during the quarantine, what we were doing here and what’s going on around our house and stuff. That’s all 100 percent shot by us, interviews shot by us. So we’ll see how it goes. We’ll see how they’re able to put that together.”</p><p>Season 5 of Outdaughtered premieres on TLC Tuesday, June 2, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaoraSZrrazx62cq52UqHqisMCmZJuto5fGbrXSZqapnZ5iwbB5wJ2mqayZo7Ruuc6rnGajmZnAbsPIrZ9mnJGjtqa4y55m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jinger-duggar-eating-disorder.html><span>←</span><span>Jinger Duggar's Eating Disorder Is Discussed in Her Memoir</span></a>
