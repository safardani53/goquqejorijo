She got a matching tattoo with her co-star.</h2><p>OK, is getting a matching tattoo with your Shadow and Bone co-star that you have ridiculous chemistry with onscreen a symbol of ridiculous friendship offscreen or is it a secret sign to the universe (if the universe was Instagram, anyway) that you two are secretly dating?</p><p>Back in October 2022, Danielle's cousin <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elva Carroll</a>, a tattoo artist, posted photos of the matching tattoos she gave to Danielle and Calahan.</p><p>What was so cute about these tattoos, you ask? The co-stars got the word, "favorite," tattooed on their arms, in each other's handwriting.</p><p>Not so fast, internet. Elva referred to Calahan as Danielle's bestie in the post.

It's understandable if the Irish actress would want to keep the truth about her dating life private.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>What's lovely about the Shadow and Bone star is the fact that she appears to be incredibly supportive of all the friends in her life. In addition to Calahan, Danielle posts frequently about her other Shadow and Bone costars too, often talking about how much she appreciates and misses them.</p><p>To add further proof that Danielle is the supportive bestie we didn't know we needed, she wore a dress made by her friend, Irish designer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aisling Kavanagh</a>, to the Shadow and Bone Season 2 premiere in Los Angeles.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Forget dating for a second —&nbsp;when can we see Danielle in 'Shadow and Bone' Season 2?</h2><p>Great news Shadow and Bone fans. You can watch all eight episodes of Shadow and Bone Season 2 now on Netflix, where Danielle returns as the Heartrender Nina. We won't spoil anything that happens yet for you, but let's just say Nina's love story with Matthias is just getting started.</p><p>You can stream Shadow and Bone Season 2, now on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vtcSlo55ll5a5rbXGmqVmnJGptq%2Bz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./inside-jennifer-lopezs-51st-birthday-cries-tears-of-joy-cake-flowers-gifts.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Jennifer Lopez's 51st birthday as she 'cries tears of joy' at personalized cake, flowers and</span></a>
