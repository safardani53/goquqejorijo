The WAP singer, 28, is seen with eight arms and posing in the typical position of the Hindu goddess Durga on the latest cover of Footwear News.
Cardi took part in the shoot to promote her new footwear collaboration with Reebok.
Critics felt it was &#34;absurd&#34; and &#34;offensive&#34; that she was referencing Durga, who is known for strength, protection and war, and is typically depicted as having eight or 10 arms, on the magazine cover."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

What she is doing is cultural appropriation and there is no one that can tell me otherwise," they wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/cardi-1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/cardi-5.png><p>Another added:&nbsp;“Excuse me ma'am this is not homage. It's disrespectful. She is holding a f***ing shoe and we don't even wear one when we go to a temple.</p><p>"And the fact that she is being compared to Durga without even knowing how disrespectful it is to Hindus makes it even worse. Educate yourself. "</p><p>Others jumped to Cardi's defence, however, with one fan writing: &nbsp;'As an Indian and a Hindu I am not offended by the post. There is nothing wrong with it.'</p><p>Another agreed: "I see where you're coming from but you gotta understand though, this is for a magazine cover about advertising her show and 9 times out of 10 it's not up to the artist on what the magazine wants to do with your cover. If they have an idea they're gonna use it regardless."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000619502452.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000614154352-1.jpg><p>Footwear News said in a statement that they take “full accountability” over the photoshoot.</p><p>"Yesterday we posted content from our exclusive Cardi B cover shoot.
