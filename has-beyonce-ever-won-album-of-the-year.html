Keep reading to find out!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has Beyonc√© ever won Album of the Year at the Grammys?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Beyonc√© lost Album of the Year at the <a href=#>Grammys ceremony</a> in 2023 to Harry Styles, and it led some to wonder whether she has ever won that top prize. Despite producing some of the more iconic albums of the 21st century, it turns out that Beyonc√© has yet to win Album of the Year. In fact, what should have been a night of triumph for her turned into yet another reminder of the Grammy's inability to reward Black music, and Black women in particular.</p><p>This isn't a new problem for Beyonc√©, who has lost Album of the Year on multiple occasions over the course of her career, in spite of being the winningest artist in the history of the ceremony, with 32 trophies to her name. Adele was the artist to beat her for the top prize last time she was up for it. Adele even asked reporters after the ceremony, ‚Äú[What] does she have to do to win album of the year?‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Beyonc√© still ruled the Grammys.</h2><p>Despite her loss, Beyonc√©'s influence still loomed large over the rest of the ceremony, and when she did take the stage, she made the most of her moments. When she won her 32nd Grammy, she thanked her Uncle Jonny, who she has described as her "godmother" and was the one to introduce her to LGBTQ+ culture at an early age.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd like thank the queer community for your love, and for inventing the genre,‚Äù she said.</p><p>Even when she wasn't onstage, those who did win major awards took moments to honor her in their speeches. After Lizzo won Record of the Year for "About Damn Time," she told a story of being inspired by Beyonc√© after skipping school to see one of her concerts.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>lizzo and adele‚Äôs reaction to beyonce losing album of the year is so real üò≠ <a href=#>#GRAMMYs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ywxnxyqSXZ</a></p>‚Äî arianators wildin (@arianatorswildt) <a href=#>February 6, 2023</a></figure><p>‚ÄúYou clearly are the artist of our lives!‚Äù Lizzo said.</p><p>Beyonc√© won Grammys for best dance/electronic recording for "Break My Soul," traditional R&B performance for "Plastic Off the Sofa," and R&B song for "Cuff It."</p><p>Whatever else happened during this years Grammys, the story of Beyonc√©'s loss in the major categories is likely to be the dominant narrative in the days to come.</p><p>In an era when Beyonc√© remains one of the most dominant artists alive, it's striking the number of times she has been snubbed for work that was widely beloved and critically acclaimed. The backlash against the Grammys is likely to be fierce, although it remains to be seen what changes could be made if any to make a Beyonc√© win more likely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna60ecGesKimk5p6psLEq2Swp55irq2u1KZkqJ5dqbWmediemKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./akash-thapa.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Akash Thapa</span></a>
