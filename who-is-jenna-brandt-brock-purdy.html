Purdy proved everyone wrong after the 49ers' starting quarterbacks, Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, both suffered injuries. During his first career start, Purdy defeated superstar <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Tom Brady</a> and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Brock Purdy's fiancée?

She attended Sumner-Fredericksburg High School, where she played on the volleyball team all four years and was a two-time team captain. Brandt also competed in track and field and played on a club volleyball team. At the start of her senior year, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>committed to Iowa State University</a>'s volleyball team and graduated from high school in 2018.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-very-close-with-her-family></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's very close with her family</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brandt comes from a tight-knit family, who can often be seen <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>making appearances on her Instagram</a> account. She says spending time with her parents and siblings is one of her favorite things to do, and even shared that her siblings were a big part of why she chose to attend Iowa State.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Family time is big to me.

She went on to play with the Cyclones for three seasons, including a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>trip to South America</a> to compete against international teams.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then in late 2020, Brandt announced <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>her plans to transfer to the University of Northern Iowa</a>, writing on Instagram that she was thankful for the "opportunities, experiences and friendships" she made at Iowa State.
