A general scroll down the webpage of online sunglass retailers reveals plenty of facts and figures but not a lot of practical information on how each pair of frames will fit on each unique face shape (and which ones are worth your money). Sure, online “try-on” functions can give you a rough idea of what a pair of shades will look like on you, but has anyone ever really looked good while staring at themselves in a faux-frame simulation? (If they have, then we haven’t met them yet.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Welp, that’s where we come in — with a roundup of the best sunglasses for women that you can buy online. We scoured the internet and purchased some of the most popular frames to test drive for ourselves; we interrogated our most fashionable editors into revealing their favorite pairs; and we even gathered tips and tricks for buying a pair of flattering frames from celebrity stylist Micaela Erlanger (who regularly dresses A-listers like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Amal Clooney</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Blake Lively</a>). Erlanger tells PEOPLE that experimenting with different sunglasses is an easy way to up your style game: “Think of glasses almost like a piece of jewelry you wear on your face." We will shout that advice from the rooftops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Erlanger also says that “cat eyes are universally flattering,” but if you’re looking for another type of frame, her general rule is&nbsp; “opposites attract.” According to Erlanger, those with square or rectangle shaped-faces tend to look most balanced with round or ovular frames, and if you’ve got a rounder or more ovular face, you might want to opt for square-edged frames.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the name of style, function, and absolutely no gatekeeping, here are the 16 best sunglasses for every style, budget, and face shape.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-all-face-shapes-safari-round-dark-tortoise-sunglasses></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for All Face Shapes</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Safari Round Sunglasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Safari Round Dark Tortoise Sunglasses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SHHpVlfGhqnIlNChVoBhlJvfr2A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/safari-round-dark-tortoise-sunglasses-4a203b4e48d841d89bf6333d3f3a397e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eye Buy Direct</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The plight of finding the perfect pair of sunglasses is a tedious one. As a picky writer constantly on the hunt for the best of the best, I’ve spent hours of my life trying on every frame style displayed at my local Sunglass Hut while my mom begs me to "just choose one already!" over a phone-bill-busting Facetime call. Luckily for you, I’ll save you the phone bill debt and let you in on the most flattering sunglasses I’ve encountered: the Safari Round sunglasses at Eyebuydirect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They look good on round faces. They look good on square faces. I’m sure they’d even look good on octagonal faces if that were a real thing — they’re just that good. Round sunglasses with a slightly upturned corner creates a slight illusion of lifted cheekbones, and these frames master the fine balance between oversized and sleek. With lightweight acetate frames and an anti-scratch lens coating, these sunglasses look and feel like they cost much more than a measly $32. They're lightweight yet still feed sturdy. Plus, you can even add your custom eye prescription to your frame color of choice to make these sunglasses truly all your own.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Round | <strong>Polarized: </strong>No | <strong>Frame width: </strong>127mm | <strong>Bridge width: </strong>21 mm | <strong>Frame material: </strong>Acetate | <strong>Color options: </strong>Tortoise, dark tortoise, black, clear melon</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cat-eye-edie-cat-eye-crystal-pink-sunglasses></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cat Eye</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Edie Cat Eye Crystal Pink Sunglasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Edie Cat Eye Crystal Pink Sunglasses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3ho6BNsrJsAUnE54vEByYqYnf2g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/edie-cat-eye-crystal-pink-sunglasses-e94067e5c50144a6bed8930c1768c6c4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eye Buy Direct</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Anyone who’s looking for a fun accessory with a pop of color, these cat-eye glasses truly suit everyone, especially our square face friends</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fun accessories can jazz up any outfit — and these sparkling pink shades are the ultimate pop of color with a flattering cat-eye shape. PEOPLE writer Cai Cramer says she reaches for the Edie glasses in crystal pink to add a subtle flair to her look for parties or weekend strolls. She even donned them for New York Fashion Week.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love that the Edie sunnies feel light yet substantial on the face, with arms that grip the sides of the face to ensure they stay on. They have an anti-scratch lens coating, so you can feel better about tossing them into your bag. But while these sunglasses are undeniably adorable, we found that they don't provide much (if any) glare protection (though all of Eyebuydirect's sunglasses have a protective coating), so they might be better suited as fashion shades than practical sun blockers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Cat eye | <strong>Polarized: </strong>No | <strong>Frame width: </strong>130 mm | <strong>Bridge width: </strong>17 mm | <strong>Frame material: </strong>Acetate | <strong>Color options: </strong>Crystal pink, tortoise, or yellow&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Cai Cramer</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cat-eye-less-expensive-jolie-cat-eye-tortoise-sunglasses></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Cat Eye (Less Expensive)</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jolie Tortoise Sunglasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Jolie Cat Eye Tortoise Sunglasses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/v3p_jG0cel2U-VLxwPPYekWCGIc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jolie-cat-eye-tortoise-sunglasses-ecd6cd63eb9e40459228c6b9d12bad39.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eye Buy Direct</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A classic pair of cat eye sunglasses should be a staple in any stylish person’s accessory repertoire. We’re especially fond of this pair from Eyebuydirect, with a tortoise acetate frame that angles up to a point. The lifted corners create the illusion of high cheekbones (we're petitioning to call these the “insta-snatch” glasses), and the three tortoise colorways feel romantic and wearable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Square | <strong>Polarized: </strong>No | <strong>Frame width: </strong>142 mm | <strong>Bridge width: </strong>20 mm | <strong>Frame material: </strong>Acetate | <strong>Color options: </strong>Black, black marble, honey tortoise, blue, powder, dark tortoise, white</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oversized-feisedy-classic-thick-square-sunglasses></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Oversized</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Feisedy Square Sunglasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Feisedy Classic Thick Square Sun Glasses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/wOPzB5qRiq_rp-GJEFdQtfhwcuw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/feisedy-classic-thick-square-sunglasses-896f46fdc7ed476681cf6d5e9520ebf6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Square-shaped sunglasses are super flattering on rounder face shapes, and this pair from Amazon comes in various fun and practical colors. As soon as editorial director Avery Stone slid these sunglasses on, she was showered with ooohs and ahhhs from every style writer in the vicinity. Little did they know, these compliment-drawing sunnies are under $16.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With an oversized, thick square frame and a beveled edge, these sunnies have a luxe feel without the luxe price tag. The frames are coated to provide UV protection, and because they are oversized, they help protect larger swaths of your face from the sun, which is great for relaxing poolside.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shape: </strong>Square | <strong>Polarized: </strong>No | <strong>Frame width: </strong>145 mm | <strong>Bridge width: </strong>19 mm | <strong>Frame material: </strong>Acetate | <strong>Color options: </strong>Olive, black, champagne, grey leopard, rose, tortoise, transparent pink/purple, transparent turquoise, white</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Avery Stone</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ray-ban-aviators></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ray Ban Aviators</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ray Ban Aviators" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/gBtjuo5NUvQl2uazC5p_H-jASEA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ray-ban-aviators-61557291b70b4944be044d5acf313a6e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sunglass Hut</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Ray-Ban aviators have cemented their status as the go-to aviator for their quality and timeless style. They were originally launched in 1937 to protect pilots from the sun (Top Gun vibes, anyone?), but you don’t need to know how to fly an airplane to look fly (we couldn't help ourselves) in a pair of these sunglasses that come in a variety of sizes and lens colors.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Writer Jasmine Hyman shares that the Ray-Ban Classic Aviators feel lightweight on her face and protect her entire eye area from the sun.

"Of course, I like that these sunglasses are super affordable," says PEOPLE editor Erika Reals, "but I was also pleased to find the quality was much higher than expected. They have a good weight to them and seem durable enough for everyday wear." She adds that the frame size, shape, and thickness also flatter her round face shape.

She’s dressed the most stylish celebs, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Amal Clooney</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ana De Armas</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Anya Taylor-Joy</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Blake Lively</a>, so her fashion advice is as good as gold in our book (she even wrote a book called <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">How to Accessorize</a>). Erlanger tells PEOPLE that when in doubt, choose cat eye sunglasses (which is why we have three on our list). As mentioned above, remember that opposites attract, so if you have a round face, opt for square-shaped frames and vis versa to achieve a fun yet balanced look.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Color</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you stick to neutrals or opt for a bright pop of color in your sunglass frames is totally up to your preference and style.

This is particularly helpful when doing things like driving, surfing, fishing, or any other activity that requires clear vision to stay safe. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maui Jim sunglasses</a> have great polarization.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But not everyone needs polarized lenses in their sunglasses, which tend to be more expensive than non-polarized ones. As long as your sunglasses have UV protection (not the same as polarization), they’ll help to protect your eyes from the sun’s potentially harmful rays.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-ce0c20e1-9ad2-4338-9061-4a450e723478></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.244552058111><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.88781431334623><p><span class=accordion__title>Where can I buy sunglasses online?</span></p><p>There are plenty of retailers that sell sunglasses online, with some that specialize in boutique and unique frames, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Akila 720 degrees</a> at akila.com, and other more general retail markets that sell a variety of sunglass brands, shapes, and prices, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">eyebuydirect.com</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sunglasshut.com</a>.

Polarized lenses are treated with a special chemical that helps to filter out horizontally reflected light, which can help to keep you safe while doing activities where clear vision is needed, such as driving, surfing, or sailing. Some people prefer polarized sunglasses because they can help reduce eye strain, but polarization is not the same as UV protection, and there are lots of sunglass options that provide UV protection without polarization (and those tend to be cheaper, too!)</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you clean sunglasses?</span></p><p>Most manufacturers recommend wiping down your sunglass lenses with a soft microfiber cloth. If your sunglasses have stuck-on smudges or you feel like they could use a really good clean, you can usually use warm water with a little bit of dish soap to rinse them off, but it’s best to double-check with the manufacturer before doing so because there’s a risk that you’ll rub off a protective lens coating.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cai Cramer</a> is a staff writer on the commerce team at PEOPLE, with a focus on health, beauty, and style.
