There’s a lot of pros to it! … [Hoda asked me], ‘Do you wash your clothes?’ And I said, ‘Yes, I do.’ But it’s also not like I’m sharing your jeans with you.”</p><p class=p1>Kotb and Guthrie meanwhile, are willing to embrace <a href=#>any potential undergarment bumps</a> for the sake of wearing underwear.</p><p class=p1>“First of all, I take the panty lines, OK?” the Oklahoma native joked to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “I know that’s what she’s worried about. What the hell?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Todays-Hoda-Kotb-and-Savannah-Guthrie-React-to-Jenna-Bush-Hager-Not-Wearing-Underwear-4.jpg><p class=p1>Guthrie, for her part, added: “I don’t care. Who’s looking at our butts?”</p><p class=p1>The Australia native further noted that she’s tired of Bush Hager constantly exchanging garments ever since the commando reveal.</p><p class=p1>“You know what? Enough [because] she also borrows my clothes every single day and then she puts them right back,” Guthrie told&nbsp;<i>Us,</i>&nbsp;while promoting her<a href=#> upcoming&nbsp;<i>Starting From&nbsp;Scratch With Savannah</i>&nbsp;holiday&nbsp;special</a>. “Yeah, no underwear. I found that out too late!”</p><p class=p1>Kotb has even asked her&nbsp;<i>4th Hour Today </i>cohost about her looks, noting she’ll proudly say, “[They’re] Savannah’s.”</p><p class=p1>Kotb and Guthrie — who <a href=#>cohost the first hour of&nbsp;<i>Today&nbsp;</i>on weekday mornings</a> —are more focused on their ever-growing résumés rather than a potential panty line. The duo will cohost NBC’s broadcast of the <a href=#>96th Annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a>, which airs later this month. As the two broadcasters <a href=#>get into the merry spirit</a> ahead of the holiday season, they are opening up to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>&nbsp;about what they are grateful for in their lives.</p><p class=p1>“I’m thankful for seasons. I’m thankful for the promise of renewal. I’m thankful for redemption and forgiveness and grace and I actually think that’s what [the holiday season] is all about,” Guthrie told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>on Friday. “So I think the way that life can restart every single day if you just want it to [and] I think that’s a beautiful promise and one of the best things about being human.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Todays-Hoda-Kotb-and-Savannah-Guthrie-React-to-Jenna-Bush-Hager-Not-Wearing-Underwear.jpg><p class=p1>Kotb — who called her pal’s remarks “amazing” — also reflected on the “new beginnings” <a href=#>that the changing seasons bring</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I’m just thankful for the freshness of trying something new and the courage to try something new and I wanna teach my girls that to risk it, roll the dice [and] go for it,” the&nbsp;<i>I Really Needed This Today&nbsp;</i>author said, referring to <a href=#>daughters Hope and Haley</a>. “Like, you know, you get one right around the sun. That’s it. So while we’re here, like, let’s do it.”</p><p class=p1>Guthrie is also excited to <a href=#>learn new culinary skills this holiday season</a> thanks to a special November 30 episode of her&nbsp;<i>Starting from Scratch</i>&nbsp;program<i>.</i></p><p class=p1>“It’s so fun. It’s the ironic ‘I have a cooking show and I can’t cook,’ but we have a special for the holidays for people and there are a lot of us out there that really don’t know their way around the kitchen and are intimidated,” the former attorney explained to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>about teaming up with chef <strong>Marcus Samuelsson</strong> for a&nbsp;<i>Today&nbsp;</i>segment. “So, it’s fun. It’s just three easy little recipes that you can make.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</i> airs on NBC on November 24 at 9:00 a.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Mandie DeCamp</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp5SWxrR5x6ibmmWRo7Fuv8CvmKemkZ16tbTIp6JmopWju6K%2FjK6lnZ2irLKivoyhmJyjXZ7AbrPRqKqsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./y6f-w7jc1mk3mrmquimfvzewotv9kjk.html><span>←</span><span>Stream live TV, Movies, Originals, News, and more</span></a>
