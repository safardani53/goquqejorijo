You will love it or hate it - and that may depend on your age.</p><p>The new X-shaped nose is probably too radical for most older drivers but my teenage son and his mates love it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/226.jpg><p class=image-caption>X-Factor?... The new Toyota Aygo</p><p>And that's exactly what chief engineer David Terai wanted. He said: "People's tastes differ. It is better to have a design half the people absolutely love, rather than one nobody objects to. The Aygo stands out."</p><p>It certainly does. The Aygo is more street racer front and back and you can have the roof covered in a different coloured decal. Then pimp it with 15in alloys (£499 extra).</p><p>There are five paint colours - plus orange and black on the special editions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/321.jpg><p class=image-caption>Improved... The new Aygo is a better drive than before</p><p><strong>&nbsp;HOW DOES IT DRIVE?</strong></p><p>Nice light steering and the suspension has definitely improved.</p><p>The 1-litre 3-cylinder engine is louder than the C1 and 108 but Toyota has tuned it slightly to give it a more sporty sound.</p><p><strong>FIND A USED TOYOTA AYGO FOR SALE</strong></p><p>Toyota claim 68.9mpg - all three manufacturers do - and I managed 62mpg on a 320-mile round trip. Road tax is free.</p><p><strong>WHAT'S IT LIKE INSIDE?</strong></p><p>The X theme continues with three grades - X, X-play and X-pression and two special editions, X-cite and X-clusive. I kid you not.</p><p>One big + for Toyota (not an X) is the personalisation. Pick your own colours on stuff like the centre console and air vents - and you can change them years later.</p><p>I'm loving the clean dashboard but I'd go for the 7in touch-screen multimedia (from the X-play upwards). It includes rear-view camera as standard. The boot space is bigger than the old Aygo at 168 litres - yet down on its French siblings.</p><p>On sale on Tuesday from £8,595 - but get in quick for a £600 launch saving</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key Facts</h3></p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £8,595</li><li><strong>Engine:</strong> 1-litre VVT-i</li><li><strong>Economy:</strong> 68.9mpg</li><li><strong>Road tax:</strong> £0</li><li><strong>Service intervals:</strong> 1yr/10,000 miles</li><li><strong>Service costs:</strong> £651 over 3yrs/60,000 miles</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> 5yr/60,000 miles</li><li><strong>0-62mph:</strong> 14.2secs</li><li><strong>Top speed:</strong> 99mph</li><li><strong>On sale:</strong> July 1</li></ul><p><strong>FIND A USED TOYOTA AYGO FOR SALE</strong></p><h2><strong>CITROEN C1</strong></h2><p>FIRST IMPRESSIONS?</p><p>Citroen have done their homework. They are targeting independent women under 30 and women over 50 looking to downsize their cars - and this is bang on the money with fun styling, a colourful interior and powered open-top roof.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/420.jpg><p class=image-caption>Looking to downsize? The Citroen C1 could be the one for you</p><p>The fabric roof option is also available on the 108 but NOT on the Aygo at launch.</p><p>The C1 has new round headlights and vertical LED daytime running lights, giving it a cheerful face.</p><p>There are eight paint colours and three fabric roof shades - black, grey and red.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;HOW DOES IT DRIVE?</strong></p><p>Comfortable, easy to drive and the powered roof on my test car adds to the fun factor.</p><p>Same 3-cylinder 1-litre engine as the Aygo but not as noisy. With stop/start available on the C1 and 108 for an extra £250, economy goes up to 74.3mpg.</p><p><strong>FIND A USED CITROEN C1 FOR SALE</strong></p><p>There's also a more punchy 82bhp 1.2-litre 3-cylinder petrol engine exclusive to Citroen and Peugeot. It does 65.7mpg, 0-62mph in 11secs and is free of road tax.</p><p><strong>WHAT'S IT LIKE INSIDE?</strong></p><p>There are three trim levels - Touch, Feel and Flair - with electric hood in the Feel and Flair. It has the same dashboard as the Aygo and 108 and the 7in touch screen with reversing camera.</p><p>Again, you can select your own colour for the centre console, air vent trim and gear lever base.</p><p>There's a free app called Mirror Screen which, guess what, mirrors your phone screen on the car's big screen for Google mapping, music, telephone and text reading. It's fantastic.</p><p>Same name, same system on the 108 (Toyota call it Mirror Link). Boot space is 196 litres thanks to the parcel shelf being attached to the glass boot lid.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key Facts</h3></p><ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £8,245</li><li><strong>Engine:</strong> 1-litre VTi</li><li><strong>Economy:</strong> 68.9mpg</li><li><strong>Road tax:</strong> £0</li><li><strong>Service intervals:</strong> 1yr/10,000 miles</li><li><strong>Service costs:</strong> £153 (first service)</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> 3yrs/60,000 miles</li><li><strong>0-62mph:</strong> 14.3secs</li><li><strong>Top speed:</strong> 99mph</li><li><strong>On sale:</strong> July 1</li></ul><p><strong>FIND A USED CITROEN C1 FOR SALE</strong></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more motors</h2></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><h2>PEUGEOT 108</h2><p>FIRST IMPRESSIONS? This is Peugeot's lion cub - the chic and classy baby version of the 308. It replaces the best-selling 107 and is targeting women drivers who want good value for money - and fashion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/514.jpg><p class=image-caption>Fashionable... The 108 is targeting trendy females</p><p>There are eight paint colours, three fabric roof colours, three interiors and seven customisation themes - diamond, dog tooth, barcode, kilt, tattoo, sport and dual two-tone.</p><p>I'm also loving the compact "eyebrow" LED headlights - part of the Peugeot DNA - and lion claw brake lights.</p><p>Every penny counts in this segment and the 108 starts at the same price as the C1 - and £20 cheaper than the VW up!</p><p><strong>HOW DOES IT DRIVE?</strong></p><p>Guess what? It's nippy, easy to drive and economical - just like the Aygo and the C1 really.</p><p><strong>FIND A USED PEUGEOT FOR SALE</strong></p><p>You also get a 1.2-litre option in the 108 and C1. The 208 has the same engine.</p><p>This little car rides speed humps very well and the short overhang over the front and rear wheels is great for tight parking spots.</p><p><strong>WHAT'S IT LIKE INSIDE?</strong></p><p>There are four trim levels - the entry Access, Active, Allure and range-topping Feline.</p><p>The dashboard, main instrument panel, flat-bottom steering wheel and 7in touch screen multi-media (from the Active version upwards) are shared with all three cars.</p><p>The 108 has three colour choices inside - white, black and bronze - and they are all enhanced by the seven personalisation kits.</p><p>The extra detail looks good on the bodywork, wing mirrors and floor mats - but the dashboard sticker on my "tattoo" version looked too cheap for my liking.</p><p>It does feel more spacious than the old 107 and the fabric roof, called TOP!, is only £850 extra. Much cheaper than the £3,000 premium for the Fiat 500C.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Key Facts</h3></p><ul><li><strong>&nbsp;Price:</strong> £8,245</li><li><strong>Engine:</strong> 1-litre VTi</li><li><strong>Economy:</strong> 68.9mpg</li><li><strong>Road tax:</strong> £0</li><li><strong>Service intervals:</strong> 1yr/10,000 miles</li><li><strong>Service costs:</strong> £152 (first service)</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> 3yrs/60,000 miles</li><li><strong>0-62mph:</strong> 14.3secs</li><li><strong>Top speed:</strong> 99mph</li><li><strong>On sale:</strong> July 1</li></ul><p><strong>FIND A USED PEUGEOT FOR SALE</strong></p><p>MY VERDICT</p><p>CITY car sales have doubled since 2005 and will hit 240,000 this year.
