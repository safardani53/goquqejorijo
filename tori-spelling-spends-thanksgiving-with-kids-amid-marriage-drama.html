Ahead of <a href=#><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a>’s <a href=#>eventful Thanksgiving meal with her brood</a>, she documented <a href=#>her kitchen prep</a> alongside two of her daughters.</p><p class=p1>“Happy Thanksgiving&nbsp;<span class=s1>🍁</span>,” the&nbsp;<i>Beverly Hills, 90210&nbsp;</i>alum, 48, captioned an <a href=#>Instagram</a> selfie with daughters Stella, 13, and Hattie, 9, on Thursday, November 25. “Three empowered females cooking, cheering, and chatting.

Thanks @stella_mcdermott08,” Spelling captioned her post. “Let the #thanksgiving cooking begin. (Yes, we brined and prepped last nite!)”</p><p class=p1>Throughout the California native’s social media footage, she showed Stella <a href=#>tying together the turkey</a> and making pumpkins out of frosting. Spelling also made a fish dish for son Liam, 14, <a href=#>who’s a pescatarian</a>. She crafted DIY napkins for the evening, complete with feathers, leaves, sticks and golden bells for decoration.</p><p class=p1>The Thanksgiving meal with her children came days after she made headlines for <a href=#>sharing the family’s holiday cards and stockings</a> without a mention of husband <a href=#><strong>Dean McDermott</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Tori-Spelling-Spends-Thanksgiving-With-Daughters-4.jpg><p class=p1>“It’s that time again. And it’s a winter wonderland at my house,” Spelling captioned an Instagram snap of <a href=#>her family’s holiday card</a> on Monday, November 22.</p><p class=p1>In the photo, the&nbsp;<i>Mother, May I Sleep With Danger?&nbsp;</i>actress posed with <a href=#>the couple’s five children</a> — Liam, Stella, Hattie, Finn, 8, and Beau, 4 — and their family pets, which include <a href=#>two goats</a>, <a href=#>one pig</a> and <a href=#>one chicken</a>. However, <a href=#>the Canada native, 55, was noticeably absent</a>.</p><p class=p1>The card’s inscription also left out the former&nbsp;<i>Chopped Canada&nbsp;</i>host’s name, which instead read: “With Love, from our farm to your home! Xoxo, Tori & Family.”</p><p class=p1>Hours later, the&nbsp;<i>True Tori&nbsp;</i>alum<a href=#> opened up about her partner’s absence</a> after a fan commented on her sponsored post: “Dean must be ‘working’ out of town and couldn’t get home in time for the annual Christmas picture.”</p><p class=p1>Spelling replied: “Fact: @imdeanmcdermott was filming his new feature film in Canada.”</p><p class=p1>One day later, the “90210MG” podcast host<a href=#> sparked further marriage speculation</a> with McDermott — whom she wed in 2006 — when she seemingly excluded the actor from her Christmas decorating plans.</p><p class=p1>“Let’s talk holiday decorating! The kids and I are in&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>&nbsp;with these personalized stockings,” Spelling captioned a sponsored Instagram&nbsp;post on Tuesday, November 23, <a href=#>alongside two photos of her family’s custom stockings</a>. As the&nbsp;<i>Help&nbsp;</i>alum held a stocking with her name on it, she stood beside five for her children, while eagle-eyed fans noticed there was not a “Dean” version in any of her gallery snaps.</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>BH90210&nbsp;</i>alum and McDermott have been <a href=#>the subject of divorce rumors since earlier this year</a>. The pair were each <a href=#>spotted without their wedding rings in June</a> and Spelling <a href=#>noted during a June appearance on SiriusXM’s&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Jeff Lewis Live</a>&nbsp;</i>that they were not sleeping in the same room.</p><p class=p1>A source told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly </i>last month&nbsp;that <a href=#>Spelling “wants a divorce but feels trapped right now”</a> after getting into an argument with McDermott.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While the insider noted that the couple “constantly fight and break up,” the latest disagreement was “really serious.” The source added that Spelling is “miserable” within her marriage yet <a href=#>has stayed “for the kids,”</a> who have “no idea” about their parents’ marital drama.</p><p class=p1>“Money is an issue and it’s always been an issue,” the insider explained at the time that it is among the reasons that Spelling “feels trapped.” Earlier this month, <a href=#>a second source told <i>Us </i></a>that “there’s no trust there” between the duo and “it’s been building up over time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp6KeerS8xKWjoqaXYsCxsc2dqmasmJa7rL%2FGoq2ippdixKrAx2aiopyjYq6utcNmpJqqop6uqLGMnamapZFk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-brinson-lebron-james-wife-who-is-she.html><span>←</span><span>Meet LeBron James New Wife 5 Interesting Facts Hollywood Life</span></a>
