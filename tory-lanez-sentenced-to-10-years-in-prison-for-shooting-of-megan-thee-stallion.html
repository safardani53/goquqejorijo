And while a decade behind bars is a relatively stiff sentence, he was facing over 22 years in prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_torylanez_02-1024x683.jpg><p>Just as the trial did not take place until more than two years after the shooting, the sentencing faced multiple delays this year.</p><p>At one point, Tory reportedly begged the judge: “Please don’t ruin my life, sir.”</p><p>There are courts and other aspects of the justice system that do ruin people’s lives. But someone who fires a gun at someone, lacerating their feet with bullet fragments? That’s ruining your own life — and possibly someone else’s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_megantheestallion_02-1024x682.jpg><p>Last December, a jury found Tory Lanez guilty over the shooting of Megan.</p><p>After the 2020 incident, the world saw footage of Megan limping near the SUV — she and Tory had been riding together.</p><p>In her footsteps, she had left a trail of blood. At first, she was reluctant to name the shooter, even when medical professionals could tell that this was not “broken glass.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_torylanez_03-1024x721.jpg><p>The jury found Tory guilty of negligent discharge of a firearm, assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and carrying a loaded and unregistered firearm.</p><p>Some of Tory’s family had to leave the courtroom after the jury read the verdict.</p><p>Apparently, they believed that he was somehow innocent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_torylanez_04-1024x683.jpg><p>Tory had previously claimed that there was a “smear campaign” against him, suggesting that those of us who covered the story must be on the payroll of some nefarious cabal.</p><p>The truth is that a lot of people had never heard of him before Megan Thee Stallion’s feet looked like they’d been through a cheese grater.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tory hired attorney Jose Baez to work on his appeal. Recognize that name? He won Casey Anthony’s acquittal about a decade ago. So … that’s a choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_megantheestallion_01-1024x683.jpg><p>Tory did take full responsibility in court, TMZ reports. That is a vast improvement over spinning conspiracy theories.</p><p>He insisted that he is not a monster, despite his actions. Tory alleged that he feels both sympathy and remorse.</p><p>Of course, many people who cannot feel those things are good people. And many people who can feel those things do evil deeds anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/08/0809_torylanez_05-1024x683.jpg><p>Baez has laid into his client’s 10-year sentence, calling it “incredibly harsh” and even “extreme.” He said that the court is punishing Tory for his celebrity status, as an example.</p><p>Well, the guy was facing more than 22 years (10 is less than half of that) for firing an unregistered gun towards another human being.</p><p>Oh, and that human being is also a celebrity. One with much, much more name recognition. But Baez is just doing his job. And that includes his plans to appeal anything and everything, as long as Tory keeps paying him.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WFcMDOq7BmpJGjsrt50p6lrZ2emLKledOoZGpoXa6yor7SZqCnZaCntrS7zWadqKpdqLWwu9OipaBln5t6rrHGmqVmrJiasm6%2F05qjpaGfo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stranger-things-joyce-pregnant-season-3-baby-bump-pic.html><span>←</span><span>Stranger Things Character Pregnant?
