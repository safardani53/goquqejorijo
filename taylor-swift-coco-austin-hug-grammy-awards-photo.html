The wife of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ice-T</strong></a>, 64, smiled from ear to ear when she had her arms around the singer and showed off her epic dress. It as a tan and silver sequin choice with long-sleeved and a low neckline.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Taylor, who was also smiling in the epic pic, wore a navy blue long-sleeved crop top and matching long skirt that also included sequins, which happened to be one of the most loved looks of the event. “Grammy’s 2023,” Coco captioned the post that included the image. She also added solo photos of her on the red carpet and photos of her with<strong> Anitta</strong> and <strong>Big Latto</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Her post didn’t end there. She showed off red carpet photos with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her husband</a>, who wore a black and silver patterned blazer, black pants, and a black hat, and a photo of him posing with <strong>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</strong>. The rock’s silky gold blazer and matching pants was also a hit when it came to eye-catching outfits at the event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/taylor-swift-coco-austin-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Many of Coco’s followers shared comments after she posted the Grammys recap. “Beautiful! Love the dress,” one follower wrote while another quoted Taylor’s song “Bejeweled” by writing, “Make the whole place shimmer.” A third wrote, “You guys looked fabulous” and a fourth shared, “Wow look at y’all! You and Ice are gorgeous together! Impeccable style, that dress is probably my favorite outfit I’ve seen you in, stunning! 😍💜🙂.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When Coco’s not attending star-studded events like the Grammys, she’s spending time with her and Ice-T’s adorable daughter <strong>Chanel</strong>, 7. Back in Sept., the doting parents shared <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a sweet photo</a> of the tot on her first day of first grade. Coco also shared <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a loving photo</a> of her hugging her only daughter during “Bring your parent to School Day,” as she wrote in the caption.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze49vZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2YvKS7jJqsrKyZo3qpwcZmnquZnaLGbq3Wmqmdq12ltbDAzmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./minnesota-man-fatally-beat-infant-daughter-baby-talk.html><span>←</span><span>Minnesota Man Sentenced for Beating Death of Infant</span></a>
