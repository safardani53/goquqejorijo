Initially, the show was supposed to start in 2022, but then HBO Programming Chief<strong> Casey Bloys</strong> clarified that it would be shifting to 2023. “The Last Of Us is shooting right now in Canada. We haven’t announced an air date yet,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>The&nbsp;Hollywood Reporter </i></a>in February 2022.&nbsp;“But it’s not 2022.

Bella is best known for playing Lyanna Mormont in <a href=# rel=noopener>Game of Thrones</a>. Bella was officially cast as Ellie in February 2021. “We were looking for a specific combination of contradictions: Someone that can be funny and quirky, and violent and rough,” Neil told the <a href=# rel=nofollow>New York Times </a>about casting Bella. When he watched Bella’s audition tape, he said, “I didn’t see Bella acting like Ellie — I saw Ellie.”</li><li><strong>Gabriel Luna </strong>is Tommy, Joel’s younger brother and a former soldier.

Joel, a hardened survivor, is hired to smuggle Ellie, a 14-year-old girl, out&nbsp;<span class=mark08ll5egfu data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>of</span>&nbsp;an oppressive quarantine zone.

One confirmed change is that the show’s outbreak will take place in 2003, as opposed to the video game where it occurs in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-last-of-us-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-17>Lead star Pedro Pascal also teased HBO’s series in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ</a>&nbsp;in April 2022.&nbsp;“There’s a very, very creative way of honoring what’s important and also preserving what is iconic to the experience of the video game, and also things that you wouldn’t necessarily expect,” he said. “And then directions that you would expect it to go, and it might not… they’re doing some really smart things, is all I can say.&nbsp;It’s in good hands because they [Craig and Neil] love it so much. So it really is made for the people that love it. And there’s some very intense storytelling for people who might be less familiar.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>The official trailer dropped on December 3 at CCXP in Brazil and has amassed over 7 million views on YouTube in just two days. “If you don’t think there’s hope for the world, why bother going on?” <strong>Bella Ramsey’s</strong> Ellie asks in the trailer. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pedro Pascal</strong></a>‘s Joel replies, “You haven’t seen the world, you don’t know. You keep going for family.” Ellie asks, “I’m not family?” Joel says, “You’re cargo.” The two-minute trailer ends with a glimpse of a terrifying monster.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>A nearly 2-minute teaser trailer was released on September 26. The majority of the teaser doesn’t contain any dialogue, just <strong>Hank Williams’</strong> “Alone and Forsaken” plays. Someone tells Pedro’s Joel in the final moments of the teaser, “Save who you can save.”</p><h2>Who’s The Creative Team?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-20><strong>Craig Mazin</strong> and <strong>Neil Druckmann</strong> are the developers and writers of&nbsp;The Last Of Us&nbsp;TV show. Craig is best known for creating the Emmy Award-winning HBO miniseries Chernobyl. Neil helped create and direct The Last Of Us&nbsp;video game.&nbsp;In an interview with&nbsp;<a class=hawk-link-parsed href=# data-url=https://ew.com/gaming/the-last-of-us-part-2-preview-hbo-tv-series/ data-component-tracked=1 rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;in June 2020, Neil talked about adapting the game for television.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“With TV you have to figure out how it communicates ideas or tells stories. In removing the interactivity of the story, how do you make it unique for this other medium?” he said. “It’s an interesting challenge, and I think there’s a lot to learn from it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22><strong>Gustavo&nbsp;Santaolalla&nbsp;</strong>will compose the score for the HBO series, just like he did for the video game. <strong>Kantemir Balagov</strong> is directing the first episode of the series. The cinematography team includes <strong>Ksenia Sereda, Eben Bolter, Christine A. Maier</strong>, and <strong>Nadim Carlsen</strong>. Executive producers include Craig, Neil,&nbsp;<strong>Carolyn Strauss</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Rose Lam</strong>, <strong>Evan Wells</strong>, <strong>Asad Qizilbash</strong>, and <strong>Carter Swan</strong>.</p><h2>What’s HBO’s Budget For The Last Of Us?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-23><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>HBO’s The Last Of Us</a>&nbsp;reportedly has a budget of $10 million per episode.
