I nearly had a heart attack.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Eminem">Read More on Eminem</h2><p>While a third said: “If Eminem died, I will need to be admitted into the psych ward. I’ve loved him for so long.”</p><p>Eminem's Wikipedia page has now had the false date of his death removed.</p><p>And this isn't the first time Eminem has been killed off through an online death hoax.</p><p>Previous rumors of the rapper's alleged death began circulating after a "R.I.P Eminem" <a href=#>Facebook</a> page attracted nearly one million likes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Those who read the "About" page were given a shockingly believable account of his demise.</p><p>"At about 11 a.m ET on Saturday (August 19, 2023), our beloved <a href=#>rapper </a>Eminem passed away," the page read.</p><p>"Eminem was born on October 17, 1972, in Saint Joseph. He will be missed but not forgotten," it continued.</p><p>"Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page."</p><p>Hundreds of fans began paying tribute to the rapper, expressing their sadness that the icon was "dead".</p><p>But while some believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report and pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network.</p><p>On Sunday, August 20 the rapper's reps officially confirmed that Eminem is not dead.</p><p>“He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.</p><p>And in December 2022 <a href=#>rumors surrounding Eminem's supposed death</a> also circulated on social media.</p><p>On <a href=#>Twitter</a>, one user falsely stated: "Holy s**t eminem died."</p><p>The hashtag #Ripeminem was created by mistake and began trending on social media.</p><p>A second wrongfully tweeted: "eminem died at 50," while another user questioned: "why did I think eminem was dead?"</p><p>"My son told me Eminem died today and almost sent me into cardiac arrest. Damn kids…" tweeted an additional browser.</p><p>"Eminem dead" was quickly proven as a hoax as he continued to post about <a href=#>his restaurant Mom's Spaghetti</a> on <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the Eminem conspiracy theory?</h2><p>There were previous instances where fake reports of Eminem's death went viral across the web.</p><p>One of the longest-running <a href=#>conspiracy theories</a> about the <a href=#>rapper's</a> passing suggests that the Eminem we see today is actually a clone of the original Marshall Mathers.</p><p>Theorists believe the star actually died in 2006 and that a sample of his <a href=#>DNA</a> was taken by the <a href=#>Illuminati</a>.</p><p>With this purported DNA sample, the supposed organization made a clone of the Real Slim Shady.</p><p>Sleuths support this theory by pointing out a few instances of the hitmaker "malfunctioning."</p><p>One thing they notice is the apparent difference in his jawline now compared to his jawline when he first became popular.</p><p>"Yeah I believe he is a clone, it doesn't even look like him anymore and his eyes are dead," tweeted one suspicious fan.</p><p>Another fan wrote: "Wouldn't be surprised if it were true. I know I do believe Eminem and <a href=#>Avril Lavigne</a> died and were replaced with clones. Their music took a drastic turn along with their appearances."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Some <a href=#>pop music</a> listeners believe not only has the <a href=#>Detroit</a>-born rapper been cloned, but stars such as <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> and <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> are doppelgängers as well.</p><p>One fan speculated: "Yep I can agree that the theories of cloning are true, Britney Spears is cloned, Eminem is cloned, Miley Cyrus is cloned <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> too."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaWiBeHyXaK6hsV2auqq6xKZknZ2RmXq1vsSnm6Kml2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bhexbefiodaasupnqgsg6skvghtbs7cv.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Bubble Guppies Season 5 Episode 23: Something Fishy Going On!</span></a>
