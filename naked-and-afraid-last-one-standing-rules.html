Contestants also have the option to "tap out" whether it's because they want to quit, or if they must leave for medical reasons.</p><p>This season, if a participant decides to leave the show willingly, not only will they be eliminated, but their partner will be eliminated as well. If a participant leaves for medical reasons, their partner will be safe from elimination.</p><p>The goal is to survive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">45 days</a> rather than the 21 days audiences see in Naked and Afraid — and the goal is not to get eliminated, of course.
