Before she takes the stage at the CMA Awards, take a look back on some of the men she’s loved through the years.</p><h2>Michael Ray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/carly-pearce-romantic-history-embed-michael.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of Carly’s first public romances was with fellow country singer&nbsp;<strong>Michael Ray.&nbsp;</strong>She revealed her relationship with the “Think a Little Less” singer in 2018, and before the end of that year, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they got engaged</a> during a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> holiday vacation</a> in Mexico.

I feel like, in a lot of ways, this was kind of my artistic expression to get out what has happened to me in the last little bit,” she told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>in an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>exclusive interview</a>. “It’s closing a chapter of the in-between, gap situation.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Michael opened up about the split in a 2023 interview on the&nbsp;Bobby Cast&nbsp;podcast. “I can’t speak for her, but for me, it was like, ‘Man, look at all this going right.’ Also, we weren’t around each other a lot,” he said, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taste of Country.</a>&nbsp;“We didn’t do counseling, we didn’t do any of that beforehand, and I think that — there was moments, that I look back now and I’m like, ‘Why didn’t I speak up on that?’ That was one of the first times I realized that her and I are opposite.”</p><h2>Riley King</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/carly-pearce-romantic-history-embed-riley.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Nearly a year after her divorce, Carly was rumored to be dating&nbsp;former baseball player-turned-real estate agent <strong>Riley King,&nbsp;</strong>when she shared a cute photo of the two of them sitting on a couch together in May 2021, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;Unfortunately, after two years, the couple <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits i</a>n June 2023. “Carly and I have parted ways and I wish her nothing but the best in both her career and personal life,” Riley told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Page Six.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Carly also shared some thoughts on why things didn’t work out in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“People date to see if they’re gonna go the distance, and we weren’t. We just simply were not right for each other, and that’s the bottom line. I am on such a beautiful journey, and I am really excited about the next chapter of my life,” she said.</p><h2>B.C. Taylor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>About a month after her split from Riley, some rumors surfaced about Carly dating her drummer&nbsp;<strong>B.C. Taylor.&nbsp;</strong>Speculation began as Carly began posting behind-the-scenes shots of herself and the drummer on Instagram, where they definitely looked cute, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Country Now</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Besides <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> where Carly and B.C. look cute, the drummer did pen a sweet message for the singer when they played on&nbsp;The Tonight Show&nbsp;in October. He posted a photo of them backstage and gushed about Carly. “I am so Proud to be with this woman. I played my first major late night television show tonight and I did it with someone I love. I do not feel deserving of how blessed my life is, but that is just how God does it. He over delivers and I am so thankful he does,” he wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Carly also wrote, “I love you” back in a comment. While their romance has not been confirmed, there’s definitely a lot to speculate on!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KaqaWxXaWyor7CnmSdmaSeu6h5x6Kqraeirnp2fZdsb29tXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./west-ham-salary-deferral-david-moyes-karren-brady-coronavirus.html><span>←</span><span>West Ham players agree salary deferral as David Moyes and Karren Brady take 30 per cent pay cut</span></a>
