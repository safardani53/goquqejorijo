Every time I had emotion, and it shows on-screen, I was genuinely feeling that emotion.&nbsp;</p>Madelyn Rusinyah, Distractify<p>Madelyn, aka Juicy, was adamant that contestants’ emotions were all real and though it may seem bizarre to the outside world, the breakups and makeups are all real.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why is Blake a robot.

During an interview with Chicago Tribune, ex-contestants Karl Collins and Nicole Tuteworkl spoke about how real the show is and explained that everything people say on the show is what they are really thinking and feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends, they ask, ‘Is it scripted?’ I just tell them no, it’s not. It’s as real as it gets. I think it’s important for viewers to know that. No one told us to do this or told us to say that.</p>Karl Collins, Chicago Tribune<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the people who do cheat and leave their significant others on the show genuinely do that. The producers themselves have agreed and said its real, so its looks like to many fans’ surprise – Temptation Island is as authentic as it can get.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-are-where-to-watch-temptation-island>When are where to watch Temptation Island</h2><p>The season will be making its debut on 16 March 2022 on USA Network and new episodes will be released weekly at 10/9c on USA Network.</p><p>The easiest way to watch in the US is to tune in directly to USA Network and watch it live, however, there are other options if you can’t do this.
