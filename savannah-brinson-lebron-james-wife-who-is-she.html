She has two children with LeBron. She found out she was pregnant while she was a senior in high school, and LeBron was an NBA rookie. She actually went to prom five months pregnant!&nbsp;<strong>LeBron Jr.</strong> was born on Oct. 6, 2004, and their second child,&nbsp;<strong>Bryce Maximus</strong>&nbsp;was born on June 14, 2007.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>3. When LeBron joined Miami Heat, she actually wasn’t excited about living in Florida… at first. “Personally, Miami was not my favorite place. Vacationing there is great: You go for three days and get some sun, and it’s time to go home,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she told Harpers Bazaar</a>.&nbsp;“When they told me it doesn’t get any colder than 50 degrees, that sold me. We get below-zero weather in Cleveland. I can’t wait to have a sunny Christmas. It will definitely be an adjustment, but we’ll make it. We’re not complaining.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>4. She’s only five foot seven, next to LeBron’s six foot eight — so she’d admitted she likes wearing heels because she doesn’t want to&nbsp;“look like a shrimp standing next to him.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>5. Savannah and LeBron actually have their own furniture line, that debuted in October 2010! She collaborated with American Signature and the line is called Home Court by LeBron James. One day she hopes that she’ll have her designs in Milan’s Salone Internazionale del Mobile.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I designed every piece for a different reason and purpose, so I love each one,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she told Capitol File</a>.
