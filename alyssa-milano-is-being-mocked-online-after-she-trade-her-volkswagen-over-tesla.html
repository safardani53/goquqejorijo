Milano gave in her Tesla for a VW. A major Democratic backer issued a statement regarding the deal, stating it was driven by a desire to avoid collaborating with firms that preach hatred and racial supremacy.&nbsp;The news instantly went viral, with many ridiculing the actress’ choice and telling her and others about the history of Volkswagen, which is remarkably similar to the reason she moved from Tesla. @Buzzpatterson, a conservative journalist, openly mocked Milano on Twitter, writing:</p><p>“Who wants to inform her?”</p><h2>The conservative wing of Twitter blasts Alyssa Milano for her Tesla purchase.</h2><p>When someone makes a claim that contradicts theirs, the internet may get rather heated. This time, Alyssa Milano went viral after tweeting that she could not participate in Tesla’s economic model since it promotes hatred and racism. She stated:</p><p>“I’m not sure how advertising can purchase Twitter space. Products from publicly listed companies that promote hatred and racial supremacy do not seem to be a viable business strategy.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alyssa-Milano.jpg alt="Alyssa Milano" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Netizens reacted angrily to her remark, alleging that the action was driven by her “hate” for Elon Musk, who now controls Twitter. Alyssa Milano overlooked the fact that Volkswagen was founded in Germany in 1933. It was designed and developed as a state-owned company by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi administration.&nbsp;Many people responded to her tweet in an effort to educate her. Elon Musk and the conservative comedy group The Hodgetwins were among those who replied to her remark.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Alyssa Milano might be the dumbest leftist cult member of them all. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3SuNj1OT7r</a></p><p>— Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 26, 2022</a></p><h2>Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter prompted Milano’s automobile trade-off.</h2><p>Alyssa Milano advised swapping one automobile for another in the above-mentioned tweet. She stated that she was able to “give back” her Tesla in exchange for a Volkswagen Electric Vehicle. Her decision was made in reaction to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter.&nbsp;Following the acquisition of the app, Musk found himself embroiled in controversy when he chose to reinstate accounts that had previously been suspended for breaking the app’s rules of service, including those of Donald Trump and artist Kanye West, both of whom have disseminated hatred and supported bigotry.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Alyssa-Milano-2.jpg alt="Alyssa Milano" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Since Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, some high-profile individuals have deactivated their accounts in protest. Musk, a staunch conservative, has been accused of supporting hate speech disguised as “free expression.”&nbsp;Many celebrities have left the site, including musicians Toni Braxton and Sarah Bareilles, television producer Shonda Rhimes, actress Whoopi Goldberg, and model Gigi Hadid.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Alyssa Milano</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYpbGjqK5uucilmKenXZ7Abq7EoqWgZZ2ksKyxw2amp6SZo7JurcWtnKtlo52ybsDRmpueZZiav27CzqWirK%2BRnLKvec6vnKtlpJrAra2O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zeinab-harake.html><span>←</span><span>Zeinab Harake Bio, Age, Height, Nationality, Children, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
