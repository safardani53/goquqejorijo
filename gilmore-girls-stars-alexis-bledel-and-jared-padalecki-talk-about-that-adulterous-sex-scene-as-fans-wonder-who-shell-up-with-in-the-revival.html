I didn’t think that it was something that made a lot of sense for my character. [Amy] likes a little bit of a shock value, so it was something that I had to wrap my head around.”</p><p>However, Supernatural star Jared wasn't shocked that the high school sweethearts hooked up.</p><p>He explained: "I knew that the entire marriage to Lindsay was a cry for help and not a union for a lifetime.</p><p>“He’s in love with somebody who he thinks he doesn’t deserve so he’s found somebody else and convinced himself he can be happy with that person.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">related stories</h2></p><p>It wasn't the moral implications of their character's actions that made the scene awkward but more the size of Rory's tiny bed as Jared is more than six feet tall.</p><p>Alexis recalled: "It was like a miniature twin. In the outtakes I fell off that bed a couple of times."</p><p>Jared added: "She did!&nbsp;That’s right! Oh my God, that had totally slipped my mind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict000283887325.jpg><p>"My feet definitely were off it. There was a shot where my waist to my head was laying on the bed but my legs were counterbalancing me on the floor so that I wouldn’t roll off.</p><p>He added: “It works for the scene because it was supposed to be awkward, so maybe that’s why they bought the smallest bed on the planet."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nintchdbpict0002838870401.jpg><p>Meanwhile, fans were sent into a tizzy when Jared was confirmed for the sequel.</p><p>However, bad boy Jess - played by&nbsp;Milo Ventimiglia - and Yale man Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry) are also returning to Stars Hollow for the four feature-length episodes but who will Rory end up with?</p><p>The series ended with Rory rejecting Logan's proposal and landing her dream job of covering Barack Obama's presidential election campaign.</p><p>So will she get back with him or do her teenage lovers Jess and Dean have a shot?</p><p>Well according to Matt - who plays Logan - Rory gets a "very, very special" ending with one of her exes.</p><p>He told People: “In terms of where things are at the end of these four chapters for Logan and Rory, it’s pretty special. I’ll say that. It’s very, very special.”</p><p><strong>Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hits Netflix Friday, November 25.&nbsp;</strong></p><br><p><b>Got a story? email <a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a> or call us direct on 02077824220</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqYmqBc36RaJ6ipJ2kv6Z5xqKppatdqMGivtJmmKWdqJ7Abq7LnpuepF2Wu6V5yZqpnpxdpa6lrcuemqShXamurbeMmpmoraRiwamt02aYna2cqbKzu9SsZKydqGLApLHNnmSaq12brq%2B%2FjLCmp5yVp3q4tM5mqqGdnKF6tryMsKCtoF2eu27Ax55kq52mnsOiuI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dillon-passage-tiger-king-star-arrested-on-dui.html><span>←</span><span>Tiger King Star, Husband of Joe Exotic Arrested For DUI</span></a>
