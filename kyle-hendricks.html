His full name is <strong>Kyle Christian Hendricks</strong>.</p><p>He was born in Newport and later raised in San Juan Capistrano, California, the United States of America, by his parents.</p><p>Likewise, his father, <strong>John Hendricks,</strong> is a pro golfer, while his mother, <strong>Ann Marie</strong>, is a medical-management consultant. As for his other family member, Kyle has a younger sister named <strong>Tori Hendricks</strong>.</p><p>Also, Kyle is American by nationality, while his ethnic background happens to be white.</p><h3>Why is Kyle Hendricks called “The Professor”?</h3><p>Talking about his education, Kyle went to Capistrano Valley High School and then attended Dartmouth College. In December 2013, the pro baseball player received his bachelor’s degree in economics.</p><p>He only received it after completing his coursework in the winter of 2012 and the fall of 2013.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ric Flair Net Worth: WWE, Bio, Career, Daughter, TNA, Wife, IG Wiki >></a></h4><p>Likewise, after this, Kyle earned the nickname “The Professor” from his teammate and fans. The name was given as a reference to Kyle’s Ivy League education and also as a homage to <strong>Greg Maddux</strong>, who had the same name.</p><p>Following this, for the Players Weekend during the 2017 season, Hendricks opted for “Hendo” as his nickname.</p><h2>How tall is Kyle Hendricks?- Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Kyle Hendricks, aka “The Professor,” the star pitcher, was born on the seventh of December in 1989, which makes him 34&nbsp;years old.</p><p>His star sign happens to Sagittarius, known for their out-going, free-spirited, and laid-back personality.</p><p>Well, outside the pitch, he is all that and fun, but in the pitch, Hendricks is a victory-hungry beast. His determination for perfection and victory might be the reason why his stats comprises more wins than losses.</p><p>Likewise, this stellar player is 6 feet 3 inches(190 cm) and has a body mass of 86 kgs(190 lbs). Despite having a big frame, his years of training and experience allow him to move freely in the field.</p><p>Moving a bit far from his physique, Kyle has stunning dark brown eyes and short dark hair.</p><h2>How much does Kyle Hendricks make? Net Worth and Income</h2><p>Kyle Hendricks has been active as a baseball player for seven years now. Since his Major League Baseball(MLB) debut in 2016, Kyle has stayed faithful with the Chicago Cubs. As expected, both parties have benefited well from each other’s support and contribution.</p><p>Not to mention, Hendricks is one of the star players of the team and is paid accordingly. Even though his net worth as of 2021 is still under review, we believe it is somewhat six-figure.</p><p>And if we really have to align with some of the public sources, Kyle has a net worth around $1million to $5 million.</p><p>Likewise, Hendricks’s contract extension with the Cubs attracted a lot of attention in the media. In March of 2019, Kyle signed a new deal with the team, which is worth <strong>$55.595 million,</strong> as reported by The Athletic‘s <strong>Ken Rosenthal.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Along with the contract amount, Hendricks also got a substantial raise and long-term security. Moreover, in 2023, his salary supposedly jumped to<strong> $12 million</strong> and will increase to <strong>$14 million</strong> in each of the next three seasons.</p><p>But for now, he is getting <strong>$7.045 million</strong> as his regular salary.</p><h2>Kyle Hendricks’ Personal Life- Wife, Marriage, and Children</h2><p>One of the Cubs’ key players and even their starting pitcher for the season, Kyle Hendricks, is a man with much potential. We can see how good he is with his teammates and during the match, but what about his love life. Is there anyone? Or is he still single?</p><p>Well, fret not, guys. It seems “The Professor” is not single and definitely not a bachelor at the moment. In fact, the stellar pitcher is married to his longtime girlfriend,<strong> Emma Cain</strong>.</p><p>Unknown to many, just like Kyle, his wife is also an athlete and has a nursing degree holder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kyle-003.jpg><p>Likewise, the two have been dating since way back in 2012. But how and where they met is still a mystery to us, fans.</p><p>Just for you guys, we got a hint somewhere that they actually started seeing each other when Kyle first pitched in Emma’s hometown of Spokane, Washington, in 2011.</p><p>Nonetheless, after dating for the whole three years, Kyle finally proposed to Emma in 2015. Of course, she did not refuse the offer, and on November 18, 2017, the two walked down the aisle.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathon Simmons Bio- Age, NBA, Net Worth, Salary, Stats, Spurs, Wife, College >></a></h4><p>Even after being married for three years, the couple has yet to welcome any children in their life. They might be planning to or not in the future is something we have no hold of. But for now, they seem to be content with their life as it is.</p><h2>Early Career- Minor Leagues and the Beginning</h2><p>Kyle Hendricks is a star pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, and we cannot deny his contribution to the team. But the achievement and results did not happen overnight.</p><p>In fact, Hendricks has been at it since his high school days. During the 2008 MLB draft, the Los Angeles Angels picked him in the 39th round.</p><p>Instead of signing with them, young Kyle chose to attend Dartmouth College and played for the college team under head coach <strong>Bob Whalen</strong>.</p><p>Moving to his college year, Kyle played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League.</p><p>Then in the 2011 MLB draft, the Texas Rangers picked Hendricks in the eighth round. This time though, he signed with the team and began his professional career as the Spokane Indians of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League.&nbsp;</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanna Rizzo Age, Married, Engaged, Spouse, Net Worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>The following year, Hendricks was exchanged to the Chicago Cubs for <strong>Ryan Dempster</strong>.</p><p>It would be fair to say, Kyle really shined with the Cubs. Right after the trade, the young Kyle started with the 2013 season with the Class AA Southern League’s Tennessee Smokies. They even named Hendricks the minor league pitcher of the year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kyle-001.jpg><p>Similarly, on July 10, 2014, Kyle made his Major League Baseball(MLB)debut with the Chicago Cubs against the Cincinnati Red at the Great American Ballpark.</p><p>Twelve days later, he earned his first win in front of a home crowd against the San Diego Padres. With that, Kyle ended his rookie season with a 7-2 win-loss record and a 2.46 ERA.</p><p>Following his impressive rookie season, Hendricks started the 2015 season as a Cubs’ starting rotation member. Then on May 21, Hendricks threw his first career complete-game shutout against the Padres, striking out seven and facing three batters over the minimum.</p><p>That year Kyle’s no decisions were the most among MLB starting pitchers, where he also recorded 8-7 with 180 innings and an ERA of 3.95.</p><p>Likewise, Hendricks opened game two of the 2015 National League Division Series and round three in the 2015 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets.</p><h2>Chicago Cubs- 2016 to Present</h2><p>With each passing year, Kyle just kept on improving, and 2016 was no different as well.</p><p>He finished the first half of 2016 with a solid 7-6 record with a rotation leading 2.55 ERA. In September, he recorded 13-7 and earned a run average of 2.09 in 159 innings pitched. Without a doubt, Hendricks was named NL Pitcher of the August.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Kyle finished the season with a record of 16-8 in 190 innings pitched and an ERA of 2.13.</p><p>He was also the first Cubs to lead the National League in the state since 1945 and the first to show the majors since 1938. Similarly, with Kyle as the starting pitcher, the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series after a victory over the Cleveland Indians.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kyle-Hendricks-2018-Highlights.png><p>Expected to start the 2017 season with a bang, Kyle was placed on the disabled list in June, following his middle finger tendon inflammation in his right hand.</p><p>After a month of rest, Hendricks returned to the pitch and posted an improved 2.19 ERA in 78 innings pitched. Despite the injury, Kyle ended the season on a good note.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boomer Esiason Bio: Age, Family, Career, Stats, Net worth, IG Wiki >></a></h4><p>Likewise, in 2018, Kyle led all major league pitchers with a 3.44 ERA. But he was the losing pitcher in the NL Wild Card Game, giving up three straight hits and one run in the 13th inning against the Colorado Rockies.</p><p>After his contract extension in 2019, Kyle was bound to play for the Cubs for four more years. Moreover, on July 24, 2020, Hendricks pitched a complete game shutout in the Cubs’ season, throwing only 103 pitches with three hits allowed, nine strikeouts, and no walks.</p><p>And entering into 2021, Kyle became the first pitcher in the Cubs history to allow 4 Home Run in the first inning and the only ninth player to achieve this feat in the history. It was in a game against the Atlanta Braves on April 18, 2021.</p><h3>Are Cubs and Jays talking?</h3><p>The online sources outline the Blue Jays and Cubs talk about a potential Kris Bryant and Kyle Hendricks trade.</p><p>The Blue Jays are in need of a starting pitcher and third baseman while the Cubs are planning to shed its payroll.&nbsp;</p><p>The Jays have already added two of the bigger name free agents after bringing George Springer and Kirby Yates. On the other hand, The Cubs have already traded Yu Darwish, and now names like Kris Bryant and Kyle Hendricks are on the list.</p><p>Henceforth, there are natural speculations about the teams discussing the trade for Kris Bryant and Kyle Hendricks.</p><p>And why not? After all, Kyle has all the capacities. He owns a career of 3.12 ERA and a 1.105 WHIP and has also conquered in the top 10 in the Cy Young Award voting twice.</p><p>And talking about Bryant, he struggles hard when he is going through an injury but is a definite threat when healthy. He has bagged three All-Star Game nods and notches more than 30 home runs and a .280 batting average over 162 games.</p><p>There is no assurity regarding the trade but Enter Scott Mitchell, an MLB and Blue Jays analyst for TSN, rendered a brief but ultimate response to this topic.</p><p>But as of now, the trade has not taken place. Both recently played for the Cubs against Cleveland at Wrigley Field.</p><p>While Kyle Hendricks dominated over six scoreless innings to win his eighth straight start, Kris hit a home run and got their victory over Cleveland with a 7-1.</p><h2>Kyle Hendricks Career Stats</h2><p>Here’s presenting you with a small representation of Kyle’s career stats.</p><table><tbody><tr><td width=64>Year</td><td width=64>W</td><td width=64>L</td><td width=64>ERA</td><td width=64>G</td><td width=64>GS</td><td width=64>SV</td><td width=64>IP</td><td width=64>SO</td><td width=64>WHIP</td></tr><tr><td width=64>2021</td><td width=64>11</td><td width=64>4</td><td width=64>3.77</td><td width=64>18</td><td width=64>18</td><td width=64>0</td><td width=64>105.0</td><td width=64>80</td><td width=64>1.25</td></tr><tr><td width=64>MLB Career Stats</td><td width=64>80</td><td width=64>52</td><td width=64>3.18</td><td width=64>193</td><td width=64>192</td><td width=64>0</td><td width=64>1152.1</td><td width=64>962</td><td width=64>1.12</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Despite being a known baseball personality, Kyle Hendricks is not active in social media and platforms such as Instagram and Twitter.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2><h3>How fast does Kyle Hendricks throw?</h3><p>According to brook baseball.com, Kyle has thrown &nbsp;17,333 pitches that have been recorded by the PITCHf/x system between 2014 and 2021.
