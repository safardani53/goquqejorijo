The sleepy Cornish fishing village of Polperro comes alive in the summer months as up to 25,000 tourists and visitors arrive per day.
Earlier this year it was voted the coolest place in the UK to live.
But independent businesses in the town say they are being pushed to the brink following a slow summer which they blame on bad weather, the rising cost of living and the lack of parking choices."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
