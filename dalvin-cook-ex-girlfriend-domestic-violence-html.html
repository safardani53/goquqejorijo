She subsequently started dating the <a href=# rel=follow>football player</a> sometime later.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ez-10 class=ez-video-placeholder-marker></span><p>But things took a turn for the worse in early 2020, as she suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage. She was pregnant with Cook's unborn child. Meanwhile, she also found out that her partner was cheating on her while she was in the hospital and&nbsp;dealing with all the pain.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>Afterward, they broke up only to rekindle their romance&nbsp;three months later. They got back together and started living in Florida and&nbsp;shared space in Minnesota, where Cook lived during the Vikings' season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However,&nbsp;in mid-November, the former couple again got into a heated argument. The argument started&nbsp;at the Mall of America, and&nbsp;when they returned home,&nbsp;the football player allegedly punched her and threw her to the ground.</p><p>Sometime later, when she was packing her belongings&nbsp;from his home to separate from him, Cook got even&nbsp;more aggressive. She said, "[he] grabbed her arm, and slung her whole body over the couch, slamming her face into the coffee table and causing her lower forehead and the bridge of her nose to bust open and start gushing blood."</p><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">further accused Cook</a> of giving her "a concussion, leaving a scar on my face and taking me through hell." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The publication also stated that&nbsp;according to the suit,&nbsp;she used Mace on him before she went into his bedroom, grabbed his gun, and called a friend for help, leading the running back to attack her with a broomstick.</p><h2>Dalvin Cook Denied the Allegations</h2><p>In the wake of the situation,&nbsp;Cook's&nbsp;attorney&nbsp;David Valentini publicly shared a statement on behalf of the running&nbsp;back, claiming his client was framed with false allegations.</p><p>The statement claimed that Trimble assaulted Cook after she broke into his residence at night using a&nbsp;stolen garage door opener&nbsp;illegally. She then&nbsp;attacked him and a guest there&nbsp;using Mace on him and forced&nbsp;Cook and his guests to remain at the residence at gunpoint for hours. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The Vikings also released a statement saying,</p><p>[they] recently received notification from Dalvin Cook's legal representative regarding a situation that occurred between Dalvin and a female acquaintance in November 2020 and led to an ongoing dispute between the parties. Upon learning of this, we immediately notified the NFL. We are in the process of gathering more information and will withhold further comment at this time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rochelle Olson, a reporter, took to Twitter to share a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">few pictures of&nbsp;Trimble</a>, where she was attacked on her face.
