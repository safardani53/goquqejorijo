I just cried.”</p><p>Bobye went on to state that Josh began to confide in the entire Holt family.</p><p>One night, while babysitting his sisters, he called the house and confessed that he was feeling tempted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“We were at a friend’s house, and Josh called my phone…Josh called my phone and all of our kids were there,” Bobye recalled.</p><p>“Come to find out, he was tempted. He was tempted that night and he was trying to call and not follow through with it,” she recalled.</p><p>According to Bobye, that was the night that a 15-year-old Josh molested his 5-year-old sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>By this time, the attacks had been going on for over three years, but the Duggars still decided to let Josh babysit his sisters.</p><p>“And evidentially, after he got off the phone with Kaeleigh, he [molested Jane Doe No. 4] anyway,” Bobye recollected.</p><p>“He had been told that he was not allowed to babysit anymore, but I guess they thought he was doing better and they [let him babysit].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Shortly thereafter, the Duggars assured their friends that they had taken action to prevent further abuse.</p><p>But the Holts began to suspect something was amiss when Jim Bob and Michelle casually checked Josh out of his treatment facility so that he could come home for Jim Bob’s birthday.</p><p>“When [Jim Bob] was able to just check [Josh] out and bring him home, we were like, ‘Something is shady,’” Bobye said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“How can that just happen if he has went down there for a crime? And [Jim Bob] just checks him out and brings him home and keeps him home?”</p><p>The Holts later learned that the Duggars had not turned Josh over to the authorities at all.</p><p>Instead, they had checked him into a facility operated by their religious guru, Bill Gothard, founder of the Institute for Basic Life Principles — and known sexual predator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It was only after they faced additional pressure from the community that Jim Bob and Michelle finally reported Josh’s crimes.</p><p>“Finally I told Bobye, ‘If [Josh] doesn’t turn himself in, I’m going to do it.’ And I kept praying and hoping that he would do it. And he did,” Jim Holt said.</p><p>Of course, Jim Bob and Michelle helped Josh avoid prosecution by downplaying his crimes, something they continue to do to this day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“Believe me, there’s a lot of stuff that was confessed that night [by the Duggars] that hasn’t even been out in public anywhere. Stuff that if we told you…” Jim Holt said, trailing off.</p><p>“Oh my goodness, this is just the tip,” he later added.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the whole story of Josh’s crimes will ever be told.</p><p>But thanks to courageous souls like the Holts, we’re starting to get a sense of what really happened.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WDcK7Om7CeZZikubV5yaKkZpqfl3qlwcagmKtlm6OyuHnToZitZZqkwKl51pqqZqWfobK0wMinnmagmah6tLXSrZyrq12Wu6V50q2gpaRdobK1eceipGaakZfGtLXTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeff-wittek-had-a-brain-seizure-from-all-the-pain-medication-after-his-operations.html><span>←</span><span>Jeff Wittek Had A Brain Seizure From All The Pain Medication After His Operations</span></a>
