Tyler McLaughlin was close with a 1,269 catch.</p><p>It was Paul Hebert, however, that reeled in the prize tuna.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639446616.jpg><p>"It was in the skiff with my dad, the fish was 1,287 pounds, and we caught two that day by hand line," he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Fisherman</a>.</p><p>"The other fish was 1,174 pounds. Both fish were around 126 inches. I was 11 or 12; it was back in 1977, and we caught them off of Provincetown.”</p><p>Two years ago, Paul also received the highest amount of price per pound for one of his catches.</p><p>He said he secured $47.02 for a fish he caught in the July season. Although he didn't reveal how heavy the catch was, he may have pocketed upwards of $47,000 should the tuna have weighed more than 1,000 pounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639313843.jpg><p>"I had brought in one of the only tuna that on the market at that time. To this day, I still have the text from the buyer saved on my phone."</p><p>In addition to their fishing income, <a href=#>the cast make a hefty salary from appearing on the Nat Geo show</a>.</p><h2>How heavy can tuna get?</h2><p>Tuna weight can depend on the type of species the tuna is.</p><p>Mackerel tuna reaches up to 17 pounds, while a big eye tuna could clock in at 250 pounds. Other tuna species include albacore and skipjack.</p><p>It's the coveted bluefin tuna that rack up the real weight. Although they are typically 500-550 pounds, they can exceed 1,000 pounds.</p><p>"Canned tuna typically comes from albacore. They're small, grow fast, and are abundant for fishing. And they certainly don't weigh 489 pounds," said Derek Wilcox, chef at Shoji in New York told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639446618.jpg><p>"There's only one type of tuna in the world that grows that big, bluefin tuna. And if you wanna try some, it's gonna cost you."</p><p>At the first bluefin tuna auction of 2019, a 600 pound fish in Japan sold for a record-breaking $3million.</p><p>The heaviest bluefin caught on record weighed 1,496 pounds according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Bay Guides.</a> &nbsp;It was caught off Nova Scotia, Canada on October 26th, 1979.</p><p>"Bluefin is the most sought after. Only bluefin has the intense marbling. Bluefin also, when it's aged properly, has a particular balance of flavors," Wilcox said.</p><h2>What is the Wicked Tuna spin-off series?</h2><p>After season two of Wicked Tuna, National Geographic released a spin-off set off in the outerbanks of North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p>The show was originally named Wicked Tuna: North vs. South but was renamed Wicked Tuna: Outer Banks in its second season.</p><p>The spin-off is on its seventh season, with the latest episode airing in October 2020.</p><p>The series is available to stream on Disney+.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000639313850.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>When does Wicked Tuna premiere?</h2><p>Season 10 of Wicked Tuna premiers on March 5 at 9pm EST on National Geographic.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The show airs every Sunday on the network.</p><p>Following the season debut episode, National Geographic put together a compilation of clips of <a href=#>Duffy and Tyler fishing together to honor his memory</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hqZGl9c4KUaJmin5eawLV5066lmmWWnsCpecKarKCgpGKvunnWopqknZRiwba6wGaamqukZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zdqbd0j-xriysvagf-vkifyg2s6yzzjx.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Paramount +: Milli Vanilli | Official Trailer | Paramount+</span></a>
