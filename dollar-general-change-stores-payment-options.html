The discount retail giant is partnering with payment service PayNearMe to offer Dollar General customers a new digital way to pay with cash and log their purchases.
PayNearMe sends customers a reusable barcode on their phone for the partner store they are shopping at.
This means when they go to pay with cash the purchase is scanned on the app, logged for both the customer and the store, and produces a digital receipt."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
