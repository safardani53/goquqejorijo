She walked down the aisle in an ivory and silk taffeta <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Elizabeth and David Emanuel</a> gown with antique lace that was once worn by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Queen Mary</a>. Its train trailed 25 feet behind her — the longest train ever worn by a British royal bride — and had to be folded like a bedsheet to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>fit into the carriage</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So cumbersome was the train that Diana told bridesmaid India Hicks to do her "best" while carrying it down the aisle. "We knew what that meant: If we pulled too much, straightening the material, her tiara and veil would slip," Hicks told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Harper's Bazaar</a> in 2018. "But if we didn't pull enough, the effect of the train would be lost."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the gown featured a ruffled neckline, a puffy skirt and voluminous sleeves. Inside were two hidden gems: a blue bow at the waistband for her "something blue" and a little gold horseshoe as a good luck charm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The people's princess also wore a custom tulle veil that was hand-stitched with 10,000 micro-pearls to create what Elizabeth Emanuel later called a "fairy dust effect" to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue U.K.</a> "We used the same sequins on the gown itself, so that it would also sparkle as Diana walked down the aisle," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Princess Diana finished her bridal look with her family's Spencer Tiara, previously worn by her sisters, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, and her former sister-in-law, Victoria Lockwood.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kate-middleton></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Chris Jackson/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate Middleton wore a custom gown by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen to wed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince William</a> in 2011. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>ivory ballgown</a> featured a Victorian-style lace bodice with a V-neckline, a skirt that was padded at the hips to resemble an opening flower and a nearly 9-foot-long train.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The dress's English Cluny and French Chantilly lace was hand-cut and hand-appliquéd with a rose, a thistle, a daffodil and a shamrock to represent the four countries that make up the United Kingdom. This was accomplished using an old Irish Carrickmacross lace-making technique that Kate claimed as her "something old," per <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>BBC</a>. Meanwhile, a blue ribbon was sewn into the dress's interior as her "something blue."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With such intricate detailing, embroiderers were reportedly required to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wash their hands every 30 minutes</a> to keep the garment clean, with needles being renewed every three hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Elizabeth II</a> lent the Princess of Wales the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cartier halo tiara</a> for the occasion, which featured 739 brilliant-cut diamonds and 139 baguette diamonds. The tiara was purchased by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>King George VI</a> for the late <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Queen's mother</a> and was presented to Queen Elizabeth on her 18th birthday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the couple's nuptials, the gown <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>was displayed at Buckingham Palace</a>, where it drew a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>record-breaking 600,000 people</a> over the summer of 2011.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-meghan-markle></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Andrew Matthews - WPA Pool/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One might expect <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan Markle</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wedding dress</a> — the reigning <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>most popular wedding dress of the decade</a> — to be overly opulent, but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Clare Waight Keller-designed piece</a> was surprisingly simple. Reportedly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>inspired by a gown</a> of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's, it was free of lace and embellishments, relying instead on its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>sleek bateau neckline</a>, three-quarter sleeves and 9-foot train for its "wow" factor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Between its pure white hue and delicate double-bonded <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silk cady material</a>, those sewing the gown took special care: They were instructed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wash their hands</a> every 30 minutes "to keep the tulle and threads pristine." Waight Keller later explained, "Over a period of time, you build up oils on your hand and when you work on something of such purity — absolute pure white — you need to keep it immaculately clean ... There were many people involved in the workmanship, and obviously it took an enormous amount of hours to do it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bride's 16-foot veil was highly symbolic as it was designed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>represent the 53 countries of the Commonwealth</a> as well as Markle's home state of California. "We both loved the story of that," Waight Keller said. "It also meant that every single one of those countries also journeyed up the aisle with her. It was a really poetic moment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The veil also contained a hidden piece of fabric from Meghan's first date with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Prince Harry</a>. "Somewhere in here there's a piece of blue fabric that's stitched inside," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the Duchess of Sussex said</a> in the HBO documentary <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Queen of the World</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Embroidered <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>crops of wheat</a>, which symbolize love and charity, were also worked into the front of the veil.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>something old</a>" and "something borrowed," Meghan wore the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau tiara</a> from <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Queen Elizabeth</a>'s own collection, which was crafted in 1931 with a center brooch that dates back to 1893. Given to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Princess Mary</a> as a wedding gift by the County of Lincoln, it was later bequeathed to <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Queen Elizabeth</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-queen-elizabeth-ii></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Hulton Archive/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Elizabeth II</a> married <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Prince Philip</a> in the wake of World War II, which meant the government was still rationing clothing — including with the royal family. The monarch collected extra coupons to pay for the gown, 200 of which were bestowed upon her by the government for the special occasion. With them, designer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Norman Hartnell</a> created a dress fit for a royal with his team of 350 women in less than three months. In fact, the designer would go on to call the piece "the most beautiful dress [he] ever made."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Inspired by the Botticelli painting "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Primavera</a>," which symbolizes the coming of spring — an apt metaphor for a nation coming out of war — the gown featured a bodice of star flowers, roses, jasmine blossoms and ears of wheat encrusted with diamanté and 10,000 seed pearls. The ivory silk design also boasted a sweetheart neckline and long sleeves and was just as lovely on its way out, thanks to the 22 buttons that lined the back and its 15-foot train.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Queen's "something borrowed" came from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara</a>, which once belonged to her grandmother, Mary of Teck. Though it snapped ahead of her nuptials, the bride had it quickly repaired — but a slight gap at the center of the diamond frame remained.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-princess-eugenie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Princess Eugenie</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">British design duo <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos</a> were behind <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Princess Eugenie</a>'s fairytale gown for her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>2018 wedding</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Jack Brooksbank</a>, which they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>created alongside the bride</a> "layer by layer, constructing it from the corset and the complex underskirt to the fitted bodice and full pleated skirt."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The result was a stunning piece from every angle, including a low-cut back to show off a scar Eugenie obtained at the age of 12 from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>surgery to correct scoliosis</a>. "I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it's really special to stand up for that," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the royal said</a> in an interview on This Morning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With a neckline that folded down at the shoulders and dipped into a low V-back, the dress flowed into a long cathedral train. It also featured several meaningful motifs that were sewn into the jacquard, silk, cotton and viscose fabric, including a thistle for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Balmoral Castle</a> in Scotland, ivy for the couple's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>former home at Ivy Cottage</a> and a shamrock to represent mother <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sarah Ferguson</a>'s Irish roots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for accessories, Eugenie borrowed the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara</a> from the Queen, which matched a pair of diamond-and-emerald drop earrings she received as a gift from Brooksbank.

In fact, it was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>first worn by her grandmother</a>, Queen Elizabeth II, on three occasions. The Queen first wore the dress to a 1961 state dinner at the British Embassy in Rome. The Queen wore the gown again one year later, at the premiere of Lawrence of Arabia, and finally pulled it from the archives in 1966, when she wore it to the State Opening of Parliament.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Originally designed by Norman Hartnell, the vintage ivory peau de soie taffeta gown, which features diamanté and a geometric checked bodice, was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>altered slightly</a> by the Queen's dressmaker Stewart Parvin and dresser Angela Kelly to include organza sleeves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, the skirt <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drew a comparison</a> to mom Sarah Ferguson's 1986 Lindka Cierach wedding dress: It was tweaked to be lined in Duchesse satin — the same material <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>as the Duchess</a>of York's sleeves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beatrice, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the first British royal bride to wear an upcycled gown</a> in recent history, discussed the significance of her choice with Caroline de Guitaut, the curator of an exhibition that featured the historical piece at Windsor Castle two months after the nuptials. "She talked a lot about the upcycling aspect and how that was really important to her given the situation that we all find ourselves in at the moment, with the [COVID-19] pandemic and the compromises being made by everybody," de Guitaut said. "It really was a one-off kind of wedding, the whole concept was just so nice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beatrice also donned the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara</a>, which the Queen wore on her own wedding day.
