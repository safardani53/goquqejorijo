That’s because the next morning, the New York–based mom&nbsp;and her 9-month-old daughter, Ruby, would be boarding a six-hour flight to Los Angeles. “I’m terrified of flying to begin with, but the idea that I was bringing Ruby only heightened my anxiety,” the <a href=#>Something Navy </a>fashion blogger tells <i>Us Weekly</i>. Still, Charnas took some solace in knowing her husband, Brandon, had booked the family three first-class tickets so that the infant could lay down flat like in her crib. Only things didn’t go according to plan.</p><p>“Once we boarded I was getting tons of eye rolls and head shakes from fellow passengers on @delta because my baby was crying (as if I could just look at Ruby and say ‘Okay it’s time to stop 😂,’” Charnas wrote in an Instagram post to her nearly 1 million followers January 1. “I tried to ignore it until 10 minutes passed, and a flight attendant came over to me and asked me and my baby to move to the back of the plane … Apparently I was upsetting and getting a lot of complaints from the first class passengers.”</p><p>That’s when the “stressed and anxious” mother reached her breaking point and burst into tears. “Instead of the stewardess being helpful and compassionate she instead made the situation worse,” the 29-year-old wrote. “I don’t know what’s right and wrong when it comes to flying with a baby but after telling a few people the story they were in shock. Thoughts?”</p><p>Her post received nearly 22,000 likes and 1,600 — mostly supportive —&nbsp;comments.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ruby-zoom-11303b5c-d1d8-47f7-a288-040231703497.jpg><p>In the end, Charnas and Ruby refused to vacate their comfy first-class seats. “We rocked her and we walked her up and down the aisles,” Charnas tells <i>Us.</i> “Finally during take-off Ruby fell asleep on my shoulder and was a dream the rest of the flight.”&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>On January 3, the CEO of Delta reached out to Charnas’ husband with an apology, refunded the tickets and gave the family $300 each. “We appreciated the [gesture],” Charnas tells <i>Us</i>. “However, it’s still not enough to make up for the awful experience we had.”</p><p><b>Tell <i>Us</i>:</b> Do you think crying babies should be removed from first class?&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamp51irq%2BwjKGcq2WTp8aqusZmmZqaqWKutLfEnWStp12hsqLCxGadoqqjqXqkuMCsqmavZGqFeX6UaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-brandie-carlile.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Brandie Carlile?
