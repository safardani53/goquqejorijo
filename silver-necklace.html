There are numerous varieties of silver necklace chains to choose from, depending on preference and budget. Snake or omega chains have a smooth style along with a shiny appearance while Rombo, Singapore or Figaro chains offer a more conventional rope-like look.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When buying a silver necklace you don’t only want to consider the design, thickness, and length but also the quality, value for the price, and durability. Here is everything you need to know when buying silver jewelry.</span></p><h3>What to Consider When Buying a Silver Necklace</h3><h4><span>Design&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span>There is an endless range of silver necklace designs to choose from. If you are buying a gift for a friend, looking for an everyday necklace, or an heirloom piece, go for a timeless design. This is something that does not prescribe to a specific trend and can be dressed up or down. A thin silver necklace with or without a pendant is a good choice.</span></p><p><span>For stylish events or an outfit that can accommodate something bold, go for a statement piece. This will be a thicker necklace with large pendants.</span></p><p><span>In the design, you can also consider the link type which can be link chains, box chains, snake chains, cable, or rope chains. The clasp type may also differ between a lobster clasp or spring-ring clasp. Ultimately your choice will depend on your personal style preference and the outfit you wish to pair it with.</span></p><h4><span>Length&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span>Silver necklaces are available in many different lengths from short choker-style chains to long chains that can be layered. Long silver necklaces of the same design can be more expensive than short ones.</span></p><h4><span>Sterling silver vs real silver</span></h4><p><span>Sterling silver is preferred for jewelry due to its durability. Pure silver is very soft. This makes it less durable for jewelry that gets used or touched frequently as it can break or bend quickly. To enhance the durability, manufacturers add other metals.</span></p><p><span>Sterling silver is 92.5% real silver with a small percentage of other added metals such as copper or zinc. Regardless of what materials are added, the final product has to be 92.5% silver. If the pure silver quantity is less or more than 92.5%, the piece cannot carry the label ‘sterling silver.'</span></p><p><span>When buying silver jewelry opt for sterling silver for the following reasons:</span></p><ul><li><b>Hypoallergenic: </b><span>Sterling silver is hypoallergenic. This means your skin won’t react to the metal as it may to other cheaper jewelry metals such as nickel.</span></li><li><b>Durable: </b><span>Sterling silver is a durable precious metal, which makes it an excellent option for delicate pieces that are worn regularly.</span></li><li><b>Valuable: </b><span>Sterling silver holds its value since it is a precious metal. This may not apply to costume jewelry made from brass or other materials.</span></li><li><b>Cost-effective: </b><span>Sterling silver is considerably less expensive than platinum, gold, and white gold.</span></li></ul><h3>Why Is Sterling Silver a Good Investment</h3><p><span>Due to its precious metal content, sterling silver jewelry is always valuable. Although the value of sterling is not quite as high as 100% pure silver, the difference is not that big. As an example, consider a piece of jewelry that is made from half an ounce of pure silver at a value of $11.50. The same piece made from sterling silver instead would be valued at $10.67.</span></p><p><span>Compared to other precious metals like white gold, platinum, and palladium, sterling silver is a much more affordable option. If you’re looking for something high-end, sterling silver may not match up. However, in general, sterling silver jewelry is a good choice. It has a much higher quality, value, and durability than base metals such as nickel or steel.</span></p><h3>Sterling Silver Identification</h3><p><span>Unless your jewelry is a custom design crafted by a jewelry artist, it will be labeled as sterling silver. This makes genuine sterling jewelry easily identifiable. Custom designs should be accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. You can take your jewelry to a jeweler for testing if you are unsure of the metal content.</span></p><h3>Caring for Your Sterling Silver Jewelry</h3><p><span>Caring for your sterling silver jewelry can preserve its value. Since silver is a soft material it can scratch easily which can dull the finish. To avoid scratches store jewelry in soft pouches or lined individual jewelry boxes.</span></p><p><span>You may also notice that some of your older silver jewelry gets tarnished or develops a dark coating. This happens when the metals react to sulfur in the air. Wearing your jewelry often will protect it from tarnishing but you can also clean it with a silver <a href=#>jewelry cleaner</a> or silver polish. Don’t ever attempt to<a href=#> clean your silver jewelry</a> with harsh household chemicals. Sometimes even a light polish with a soft cloth is enough to brighten up the sparkle again.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwtsSwnKWqqWTAqrjVnqlmppWYuK2twp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./drake-mccain-fxge-html.html><span>←</span><span>Drake McCain (World Music Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
