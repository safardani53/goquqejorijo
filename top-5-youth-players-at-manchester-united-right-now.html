<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Top 5 Youth Players At Manchester United Right Now (2022)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Manchester United</strong> is one of England’s most illustrious clubs in the modern era of football. Their glorious footballing heritage, values, and traditions have all played a significant role in their success. A large part of the credit goes to the world-class talent produced by their academy.</p><p>The Red Devils have always been proud of their faith in young players, leading them to success over the years. United’s academy produced iconic players such as David Beckham, Paul Scholes, and Paul Pogba.</p><p>On that note, let’s take a quick look at Manchester United’s top five youth prospects right now (2021)</p><h2>Number 5: Shola Shoretire (age 17)</h2><p><strong>Shola Shoretire</strong> is one of Manchester United’s most promising under-23 players.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shola-Shoretire.jpg><p>He made his debut for the United first-team under current manager Ole Gunnar Solskjr. Shoretire came on as a substitute for Marcus Rashford during a match against Newcastle United in August.</p><p>After replacing Mason Greenwood in a match against Real Sociedad, he became the club’s youngest player to make a European debut.</p><p>The explosive forward’s outstanding play in front of the goal saw him score 10 goals and provide six assists for his team the previous season. Shoretire finished the season as the winner of United’s prestigious Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award for 2020/21.</p><h2>Number 4: Hannibal Mejbri (age 18)</h2><p>Manchester United announced the academy signing of Tunisian youth player <strong>Hannibal Mejbri</strong> in mid-2019. The player is one of the most expensive additions to United’s academy in recent memory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hannibal-Mejbri.jpg><p>Member, who is eighteen years old, is a player with an incredible skillset and an extraordinary vision that allows him to be an astute playmaker. The player’s deft touch was captured on video as he linked up with United’s other young starlet Amad during an under-23 match.</p><p>Hannibal is a player United expects to jump to their illustrious first team. He could provide a new option for the club’s playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, and thus reduce his workload.</p><p>The Tunisian made his Premier League debut for the Red Devils against Wolves in the 82nd minute, coming on to replace Juan Mata.</p><h2>Number&nbsp; 3: Amad Diallo (age 19)</h2><p>After Manchester United failed to sign their top target, Jadon Sancho, in the summer of 2020, United went all-in to sign <strong>Amad</strong> in an estimated €40 million deal, making him one of the best talents in the Italian league.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Amad-Diallo.jpg><p>The Ivorian joined the club in 2021 after leaving Atalanta in Italy. He made his first-team debut for United against Real Sociedad in the Europa League. Amad scored an incredible headed goal against AC Milan in their next match in the same knockout competition. It ensured their advancement to the next round.</p><p>After such a promising start, United will undoubtedly have high expectations for the Ivory Coast international.</p><h2>Number 2: Jadon Sancho (age 21)</h2><p>Manchester United had a protracted battle with Borussia Dortmund over the transfer of English sensation<strong> Jadon Sancho</strong>. The club finally announced his signing in the summer of 2021 for a fee of more than £73 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jadon-Sancho.jpeg><p>Jadon Sancho, who moved to Germany in 2017, has established himself as one of England’s most appealing exports. The player’s outstanding performances abroad established him as one of the world’s most highly regarded attacking prospects.</p><p>During United’s season-opening match at Old Trafford against Leeds United. Sancho played his first game for his new team. However, he is off to a shaky start to the season. On the other hand, United has no doubts about the attacking quality he will bring to their teams in the future.</p><h2>Number 1: Mason Greenwood (age 20)</h2><p><strong>Mason Greenwood</strong> is undeniably one of United’s most talented players, having risen quickly through the ranks of the club’s youth academy. When it comes to scoring goals, he is a player with incredible talent. Fans have already referenced Manchester United’s goal-scoring legends, such as Robin Van Persie. Greenwood has a promising future at the club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/g.jpg><p>He’s also had a strong start to the season, scoring four goals in nine league appearances. Greenwood made his debut against Cardiff City at the end of the season in 2019. In over 117 professional appearances for the club, he has scored 33 goals and provided more than ten assists.</p><p>Greenwood is hoping to keep his hot scoring streak going. Manchester United are confident that they have a generational talent and that he will become the club’s best finisher.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanq6u9Stn2aonJbGpr7SZpitZZ2Wu6S0xKyrnqpdqruqwMSdZKuhl53BbrrOsGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reese-witherspoons-son-deacon-phillippe-makes-acting-debut.html><span>←</span><span>Reese Witherspoon's Son Deacon Phillippe Makes Acting Debut</span></a>
