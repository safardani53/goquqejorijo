I didn’t realise that he was still in the family."</p><p>Given the teddy was 80 years old, his fur had seen better days, he’d lost his eyes and the squeaker inside him no longer worked.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, though, Amanda Middleditch and Julie Tatchell - <a href=#>The Repair Shop</a>’s resident teddy bear ladies - were on hand to restore glory to the cuddly pal.</p><p>Returning the bear to Beryl, she opened the box before she burst into floods of tears, overcome with emotion to be reunited with it.</p><p>"Oh he’s gorgeous," she exclaimed. "He’s gorgeous. He looks happy. I don’t believe it. I feel as if Paul’s here with us."</p><p>Viewers were left emotional at the touching moment, with many taking to <a href=#>Twitter</a> to air their thoughts.</p><p>One viewer said: "The Repair Shop breaks me every time, but seriously the lady with teddy bear."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>Someone else penned: "Proper sobbing at The Repair Shop. Humans at their most tender and endearing. We were all children once."</p><p>Another added: "Teddy bear with no eyes, and a missing squeak on The Repair Shop, this is a recipe for tears if ever I saw one."</p><p><strong>The Repair Shop returns to BBC One on Wednesday, 22 December at 8pm.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/msemail_repair_2JPG-JS700596377.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlnZYJ3fZFqZq2glWK%2FprzAoqlmq5ikvW7AxJ2bsmWSmq6zedaoqaWcXayus3nTsKZo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reese-witherspoon-posts-legally-blonde-alternate-ending-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Reese Witherspoon Posts 'Legally Blonde' Alternate Ending Pics</span></a>
