Vivienne Westwood’s iconic designs were frequently featured on dozens of stars, including <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> and more.</p><p>The British designer, <a href=#>who died in December 2022 at the age of 81</a>, got her start in the early ‘70s with her romantic and business partner, <strong>Malcolm McLaren</strong>. The twosome, who shared son <strong>Joseph Corré</strong>, opened a rock-inspired clothing shop in London in 1971, selling vintage designs, punk-rock T-shirts and more. In 1981, Westwood debuted her first fashion show with McLaren. Two years later, she became an independent designer.</p><p>While working solo, Westwood expanded her designs to the infamous “mini-crini,” a modern-day mini skirt attached to a Victorian style skirt. She also created pantsuits, red carpet gowns and more.</p><p>The environmentalist famously designed Carrie Bradshaw’s extravagant wedding dress, which <a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a> wore in the first <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> film. The iconic getup consisted of a dramatic A-line skirt and strapless neckline.</p><p>When it came to over-the-top designs, Westwood knew best. <a href=#><strong>SZA</strong></a> stunned in one of her ensembles at the <a href=#>2022 Met Gala</a>, turning heads on the red carpet when she arrived in a magenta strapless gown. The A-line frock was finished with a thigh-high slit, revealing her latex tights and heels. To complete the look, the Missouri native wore <a href=#>matching latex gloves and an oversized black hat</a>.</p><p>Another one of Westwood’s most discussed designs was <a href=#><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a>’s frock at the <a href=#>2021 BRIT Awards</a>. The “Cold Heart” singer looked seriously stylish in a yellow off-the-shoulder mini dress, which had a train falling from her hip and purple netting over the whole piece. To spice up the look, the England native added a sheer pair of stockings and strappy platform pumps. Her hair was styled in an updo, she accessorized with a pearl choker for a regal look.</p><p>Kardashian also sported the English fashion house at the <a href=#>2019 Emmys</a>. The Kardashians star looked extra classy in a vintage Westwood design: a velvet, floor length dress that included a corset top, bodycon skirt and a ruffle detail on her lower back. The ensemble came together with a gorgeous train. The California native added bling to the look with heavy diamond chains and a cross necklace. For glam, she donned soft eyeshadow and wore her hair in loose curls.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Halsey</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a> and more A-listers paid tribute to Westwood after her death.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hadid, for her part, shared a heartfelt message to the late designer <a href=#>via Instagram</a> shortly after Westwood’s death was announced. “From the first day I met you to the last day I saw you, you made me smile , listen, learn and love more than the day before.” The runway model continued, “I will forever be grateful to have been in your orbit , because to me and most , in fashion & in humanity, you, Vivienne, were the sun.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Westwood’s most memorable red carpet designs over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvSrZirq12stbB5x5qtnmWnpL%2BvedWiraKdnqOybsPErKuwp5%2BZeqy1zGaimqqUlsCptcCnZKanopp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pauley-perrette-25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-2014261.html><span>←</span><span>Pauley Perrette: 25 Things You Don't Know About Me</span></a>
