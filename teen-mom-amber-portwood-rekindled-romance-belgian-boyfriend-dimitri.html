She is taking things slowly, but he's been there for her during a really tough time."</p><p>Earlier this month, Amber and Andrew were back in court after the <a href=#>Teen Mom</a>'s ex <a href=#>filed an emergency motion</a> to end Amber's visits with their son James.</p><p>"Dimitri has been her ear through the whole ordeal," the insider added.</p><p>Amber and her Belgium beau began dating in 2020 and they were ultimately separated during the COVID lockdown before <a href=#>breaking up sometime in early 2021</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More Amber Portwood">Read More Amber Portwood</h2><p>The father-of-two from Belgium had first reached out to Amber over social media.</p><p>The re-kindled romance has helped Amber as she works through the latest drama in her court battle with her ex, Andrew, over a recent incident with their son James.</p><p>Another source close to Amber confirmed that she and Dimitri have remained in touch but claimed that they are not together as a couple right now.</p><p>According to a recent report, Amber claimed in court that her ex had an overreaction when their <a href=#>5-year-old son fell and busted his lip</a> during a FaceTime call.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Andrew claimed that his ex had been a "neglectful parent" after a recent incident that occurred while the child was visiting his mom at a hotel, according to court documents uncovered by <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ashley's Reality Roundup.</a></p><p>The court docs alleged that on May 16 during a video call with Andrew, James "busted his lip while jumping on the bed."</p><h2>THE INCIDENT</h2><p>“The minor child had busted, bloody lip. The minor child became hysterical, [Amber] began yelling, and [Amber] immediately terminated the video call with [Andrew] and refused to respond for an extended amount of time to his numerous inquiries, including phone calls and text messages, as to what happened and what was going on," the cinematographer claimed in his filing.</p><p><a href=#>Andrew</a> asserted that he “feared for [James’] safety” and went to Amber’s hotel and retrieved James somewhere around 1.30 a.m.</p><p>After his arrival, the father alleged in court docs that <a href=#>Amber</a>, 33, made a scene in front of the little boy because Andrew, 39, was taking him away.</p><p>Amber has filed a rebuttal against the claims, alleging that James' injury was "not an emergency" and that she believes Andrew is hoping to interfere with her time with her son and “cause her emotional and likely financial hardship.”</p><p>“Father fails to advise the Court that James suffered bloody lip during the video call with his Father. James was jumping on the hotel bed and bit his lip. A five-year-old jumping and biting his lip (on video call with his Father) is not an emergency," she wrote in her response.</p><p>“When the child injured his lip, Mother terminated the video call to tend to him. During this time, Mother missed phone call from Father. She returned his call and spoke with Father two minutes later.”</p><h2>'HYSTERICAL' REACTION</h2><p>Amber asserted that James only became "hysterical" due to his father's reaction on the other line.</p><p>“Mother advises the Court that the minor child only became upset because of Father’s exaggerated and relentless statements and reactions during the video call and upon arriving at the hotel where Mother and James were staying," she wrote.</p><p>"As a result of Father’s actions and behavior, Mother’s parenting time was interrupted and prematurely ended.”</p><p>At 1.36 AM Amber texted Andrew: “How dare you ask to pick him up because he jumped up and bit his lip!” according to screenshots of messages she submitted to the court</p><p>“…You broke my heart for this one seriously," she added.</p><h2><strong>ALCOHOL ACCUSATIONS</strong></h2><p>Andrew also accused Amber of drinking while <a href=#>caring for their son</a>, according to the court documents uncovered by <a href=#>The Ashley's Reality Roundup.</a></p><p>But the <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> star provided restaurant receipts showing she had only ordered "one vodka spritz" while out with the child.</p><p>“An adult responsibly drinking an alcoholic beverage in the presence of minor child is not an emergency," she claimed in her response.</p><h2><strong>COURT DECISIONS</strong></h2><p>Amber has asked that the judge on the case dismiss Andrew's emergency motion and that he pay her attorney fees which have now totaled over $6,000.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The mother of two also fired her previous lawyer and hired a new one amid this emergency filing.</p><p>The judge has initially sided with Amber, ruling that Andrew's presented information does not qualify as an "emergency."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/feelin-type-way-teen-mom-629188591.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/teen-mom-amber-portwoods-ex-631836201.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/teen-mom-amber-portwoods-ex-807800360-3.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZmiCeoGYaKuenZ5iurC5jJqkm52iYr2wvtOwpqicXaeyrLXNnaOenF2nvK6tzZycZpqVobSqrc1mmaixlqe2prrDZpuipZmpv6p7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sherri-shepherd-catsuit-beyonce-concert-video.html><span>←</span><span>Sherri Shepherd Slays Catsuit For Beyonce Concert In New Video Hollywood Life</span></a>
