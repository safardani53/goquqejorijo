The eclectic and colorful designer actually turned down the show’s prizes — at the time $100,000 and a mentorship from Banana Republic — taking issue with a contractual clause designating 10% of all future revenue to the Project Runway production company, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>TV Guide reported</a>. This clause has since been taken out of the contestants’ contracts.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since his win, McCarroll has continued his work as a designer, but has stepped out of the public eye, shutting down his blog and limiting TV appearances. Most recently, he worked for the wardrobe department of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>HBO’s Kate Winslet-led Mare of Easttown.&nbsp;</a><br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-chloe-dao-season-2></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Chloe Dao, Season 2</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Chloe Dao.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Mike Ruiz/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal/Getty; Bob Levey/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Appearing on the hit reality show in 2005, Chloe Dao was known for her billowing sleeves and intricate florals, bringing some whimsy to the competition. Dao was reserved in her drive to win, but still beat out the competition, including former RuPaul’s Drag Race judge Santino Rice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Houston-based designer spent the years since Project Runway building out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>her design business</a>, selling everything from handbags and jewelry to those light dresses that caught the judges' attention.

The designer, who joined the show after seeing the success of his friend Santino Rice, was known for his grunge, punk-inspired aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the show, Sebelia <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quickly landed a gig designing a live-action Bratz film</a>, but was fired after publicly calling the characters “slutty.” Soon after, Sebelia’s own label Cosa Nostra, which had previously dressed the likes of Elton John and Madonna, closed. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sebelia jumped around design jobs</a>, and returned for the third season of Project Runway: All Stars.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leanne-marshall-season-5></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leanne Marshall, Season 5</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Leanne Marshall.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jay Sullivan/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty; Richard Bord/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many didn’t expect Leanne Marshall to make it far; being placed in the bottom two on episode 2 was not a great omen for her. Still, Marshall pulled out a series win for season 5 of Project Runway, inspiring the judges with the feminine curves of her wave-inspired collection.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After winning the reality competition show, Marshall moved to New York City and narrowed in on her vertical of interest: wedding dresses. She still owns and operates <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>her own wedding brand</a>, and maintains a brick-and-mortar store in New York.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-irina-shabayeva-season-6></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Irina Shabayeva, Season 6</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Irina Shabayeva.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Michael Yarish/Lifetime/Everett; Irina Shabayeva/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hailing from Georgia and holding Russian Jewish heritage, Irina Shabayeva brought a never-before-seen perspective to Project Runway. And, with her metropolitan style, Shabayeva remained a front-runner up until her season 6 win.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since 2009, when Shabayeva won her season, she has expanded her portfolio as a designer. She currently serves as creative director for two different labels, Irina Shabayeva Couture and Maison MJZ. You can find an Irina Shabayeva dress on many a red carpet, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>most recently on Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-seth-aaron-henderson-season-7></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Seth Aaron Henderson, Season 7</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Seth Aaron Henderson.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Amanda Schwab/Starpix/Shutterstock; Jeff Schear/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With his signature black-and-red color palette, Seth Aaron Henderson quickly became the voice of a new fad in fashion: emo . The judges chose to honor this bold styling twice, with Henderson winning both season 7 of Project Runway and season 3 of Project Runway: All Stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After winning season 7, Henderson created his own line, which still operates today. Based out of West Hollywood, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>SethAaron</a> sells primarily gothic gowns and buckle accessories, as well as some pet couture.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gretchen-jones-season-8></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gretchen Jones, Season 8</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Gretchen Jones.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Barbara Nitke/Lifetime/Everett; Leslie Kirchhoff/CondÃ© Nast/Shutterstock</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Season 8 provided one of the most contentious finales of Project Runway, with the judges presenting an even split between competitors Gretchen Jones and Mondo Guerra. Ultimately, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jones won out, though to some fans, her win remains controversial</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Jones worked in the fashion space immediately following Project Runway, she eventually headed off to college, receiving her MBA in Fashion from University of the Arts London. She now runs her own company <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Weird Specialty</a>, which provides creative consulting services to companies.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-anya-ayoung-chee-season-9></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Anya Ayoung-Chee, Season 9</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Anya Ayoung-Chee.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Barbara Nitke/Lifetime/Everett; Johnny Nunez/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former Miss Universe Trinidad and Tobago surprised audiences when she came to Project Runway young and hungry, having a keen eye for design but only four months of sewing experience. Still, once she began showing her vibrant outlook on fashion, Ayoung-Chee’s path to the finale was undeniable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ayoung-Chee is still a designer, selling her clothes primarily through <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital commerce</a> from her home in Trinidad and Tobago. She maintains a bright outlook on design, selling heavily color-blocked and patterned resort wear.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dmitry-sholokhov-season-10></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Dmitry Sholokhov, Season 10</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dmitry Sholohov.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Richard McLaren/Lifetime/Everett; Hippolyte Petit/Getty&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet another double winner, Dmitry Sholokhov first gained attention in season 10 of Project Runway for his drab black garments with spare pops of color. Sholokhov would go on to easily win that season, and later win the fourth season of Project Runway: All Stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since his wins, Sholokhov has remained the creative director of his eponymous brand, pumping out those chic garments in primarily black hues.

This lack of formal training gave her an edge, with Franklin quickly becoming known for her rule-breaking garments, that eventually helped her win the show's 11th season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Portland native continues to design prolifically, premiering her brand in limited runway shows and multiple local boutiques.

With her floor-length, linearly patterned dresses, Streater was the franchise’s third double winner, taking the crown for season 12 of Project Runway and season 5 of Project Runway: All Stars.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Straight off the reality hit, Streater took a job as a sweaters and knitwear designer for Urban Outfitters, while simultaneously working on her own label. Streater has since parted ways with the lifestyle chain, working full time as lead designer for her own <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dom Streater Studio</a> in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sean-kelly-season-13></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sean Kelly, Season 13</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Sean Kelly.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Barbara Nitke/Lifetime/Everett; Sean Kelly/Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sean Kelly was an immediate favorite of just about everyone on Project Runway, including the fans. In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Stuff</a>, Tim Gunn even admitted that Kelly was his favorite contestant in the show’s history. Thus, Kelly’s win on the show's 13th season was almost obvious.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Kelly may have been known for his evening wear on season 13, he made a swift pivot post-win to swimwear.

Enter Ashley Nell Tipton, the season 14 contestant who really brought plus-sized fashion to the show. By introducing body diversity, Tipton not only found herself the season’s winner, but also changed the trajectory of the show to be more inclusive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the strongest breakouts of 2010s Project Runway, Tipton went on to build her<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> body inclusive clothing brand</a> from the ground up. Under that umbrella, Tipton also teaches sewing classes and writes blog posts on loving one's body type.
