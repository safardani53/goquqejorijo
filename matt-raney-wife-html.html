In the show, he is portrayed as a hunting and fishing expert and is responsible for feeding the Raney family throughout the year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>His Childhood Introduced him to Hunting and Fishing</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Matt Raney</a> was born and brought up&nbsp;in the Alaskan wilderness. He&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;learning survival skills in Alaska and became his family's most decorated hunter.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I've had encounters with bears, wolves, and run naked with the Caribou...Our family has embraced a lifestyle of subsistence. Through all the years our only objective has been to fill out freezer full of salmon, halibut, caribou, doll sheep and moose. We've had good years and bad, but I can't remember the last time I ate at a fast food place or bought meat from a market," Raney told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Discovery</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In the show Homestead Rescue as well, Matt shows his passion for hunting and fishing, whether by doing it himself or teaching other people. Discovery states that the professional hunter and heir of his family homestead business hunts all year for his parents, sisters, and brothers. It mentions that his father joins him during big-game hunting, whereas his sister Misty tags along with him when he is out fishing.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>According to the website, Raney—who is also a professional hunting guide—hunted over "1000 pounds of&nbsp;fish, moose, caribou, and sheep." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Matt and His WIfe Katie Raney are Both Passionate about Hunting</h2><p>His passion for hunting is matched by his wife’s love for the same. His partner, Katie Raney, too, is very enthusiastic about hunting and living the life of a homestead.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They have even appeared together in a few episodes of Homestead Rescue: Raney Ranch. In particular, the couple was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen</a> on the thumbnail of episode three of the latest season titled “Raney Days Are A-Comin’”.</p><p>And her love for hunting can also be seen on the couple’s Instagram accounts. Both of the couples have posted multiple pictures that show them hunting together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For instance, in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of Matt’s more recent posts</a>, the couple was&nbsp;seen holding 300 Winchester Magnum rifles. The caption of the post clarified that they were practicing hitting targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, in another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a>, the couple was seen actually out in the wilderness hunting moose in Alaska. The caption implied that the picture&nbsp;was taken while they were filming an episode for the show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Adventure-loving Husband and Wife are a Long-time Couple</h2><p>Matt and his wife Katie Raney have been together for many years. If we only go by his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first post</a> related to her on Instagram, which was uploaded on May 28, 2012, we can say that they have been together for at least a&nbsp;good eight years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And they took ample time to decide to take their relationship to the next level. Specifically, they took at least four years to decide on their future and eventually concluded that they should get married and start a family. Therefore, the couple tied the knot on May 2, 2016, as his 4th marriage <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">anniversary post</a> suggests. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Pair has a Son Together</h2><p>Matt also has a kid with his wife. Their son was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born </a>on March 17, 2018. And on March 18, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;that they had decided to name him Indy Lorel Raney. The family now lives together on a ranch in Alaska that is owned by Matt's father Marty.</p><p>Fans could get the latest insight about Matt and his lifestyle via his Instagram profile: it is filled with pictures of his wife and son, where they can be seen doing things such as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">going for drives</a> around the ranch, gardening, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picking veggies</a>, and other homestead things. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6KutcCMq5innalixKqyxGefraWc</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kendall-jenner-shoots-down-gay-rumors-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Kendall Jenner Shoots Down Gay Rumors... and More!</span></a>
