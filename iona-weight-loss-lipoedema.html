What made it worse was that I still failed the physical exam when I applied to join the police, which left me feeling hopeless. I stopped training and started to comfort-eat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-feeling-body-confident-overseas.jpg><p>In January 2011 I went to Georgia in the US to study business administration.</p><p>Scoffing endless slices of pizza, I was soon a size 22 and weighed 18st. I knew I was too big, but couldn’t find the motivation to slim down even though I loathed my frumpy appearance.</p><p>I returned home that May and, instead of trying to lose weight, I hid my body under baggy tops and trousers.</p><p>When I landed a job as an accounts clerk in an office in 2013, I had to squeeze my belly under my desk and my confidence hit an all-time low.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-in-a-high-energy-work-out-video.jpg><p>By the following March, I had back pain and felt sluggish. I was only 22 and didn’t want to live like that, so I plucked up the courage to go to female-only Zumba classes.</p><p>Once again, I began giving up my favourite sugary snacks for healthy vegetables and training three times a week, running and lifting weights.</p><p>As I made friends at the gym, I could feel my confidence growing, but I still wasn’t happy.</p><p>Even though I got down to 12st over nine months and could fit into a size 10-12 on my top, my legs were still a size 16.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-before-she-lost-weight.jpg><p>They’d also started to look bumpy, like orange peel.</p><p>I’d look at myself in the mirror and feel dismayed – but it never occurred to me to see a GP.</p><p>I assumed that must be how my body was naturally.</p><p>Thankfully, family and friends were very supportive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-showing-off-her-curves.jpg><p>I’d worked hard to get into shape, so decided to post pictures of myself online in March last year.</p><p>I was shocked when some people accused me of having surgery.</p><p>They couldn’t believe I had such a tiny waistline with such chunky legs.</p><p>I refused to let them get me down, though, and continued to upload photos and workout videos – even when my legs crept up to a size 18 last summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-Chira-in-the-gym.jpg><p>I loved that most people saw me as an inspiration.</p><p>Then, in April 2017, a new follower called Karen suggested I might have lipoedema, a condition she suffered from.</p><p>I discovered it was an abnormal build-up of fat cells that made legs look large and lumpy.</p><p>It made perfect sense.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-in-bright-sports-wear.jpg><p>Armed with research, I saw my GP, who referred me to a specialist, and in November I was diagnosed with lipoedema.</p><p>It was a relief, but there was little I could do.</p><p>Liposuction was one solution, but it didn’t always work.</p><p>Most people try to manage it with low-carb diets and fitness, which is what I do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioanas-Instagram-EDIT.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">BTW</h3></p><ul><li>78% of women with lipoedema developed it between the ages of 18 and 25.*</li><li>Entourage actress Beau Dunn was diagnosed in 2011.</li></ul><p>Find support at <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lipoedema.co.uk.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ioana-goes-to-the-gym-around-five-times-a-week.jpg><p>Since my diagnosis I’ve become friends with Karen and I’m studying to be a personal trainer.</p><p>Although I’m single, I’m so body-confident I wouldn’t let it affect me if I was dating, and being called a fat pig no longer bothers me.</p><p>Of course people still troll me, but for every negative comment, I get 50 positive ones, so I know I’m making a difference.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Ferne McCann's diet and exercise plan tried and tested</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5VvaW5oYWl8qrvNmmSwnZmctbV5y6iqrGWcnr2wscOepJpn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./city-of-lies-johnny-depp-tupac-biggie.html><span>←</span><span>What is City of Lies about and is it a true story?</span></a>
