His parents are Rusty Aaronson and Janell Aaronson.</p><p>Moreover, his dad also used to play soccer. Rusty was a collegiate <a href=# rel=noopener>soccer player</a> who played for Monmouth University.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, he runs a trendy and successful youth club in New Jersey. Hence, mentioning who got Brenden into the sport is probably unnecessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Rusty used to teach and train his sons as kids and teach them soccer technics and rules. As a result, Brenden started playing soccer when he was only ten years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, he used to train and practice with his brother Paxten. So, the brothers share a close bond.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Brenden-Aaronson-Family.jpeg><p>Besides that, his younger brother Paxten Aaronson is also a soccer player. Currently, Paxten plays for his older brother’s former team Philadelphia Union.</p><h3>The Bond Between The Brothers</h3><p>The younger brother credits Brenden for his developing skills, as he can learn from his older brother’s mistakes and errors.</p><p>He said, “Watching him set the path, it obviously gave me hope because I was like, OK, I see him doing it, so it’s a clear vision for me. I was like, alright, now I can really go after this.”</p><p>Pexton added, “He set the pathway and me saying, OK, he made a mistake, me knowing he did that and fixing my way around it. I give him a lot of credit for setting the path, and it kind of helped me out a lot.”</p><p>Not to mention, the midfielder’s younger sister, Jaden, also plays soccer and is very good at it. Aaronson said in an interview about his sister,</p><p>“She’s turning out to be a very, very good young player. I’ve been to a few of her games. She kills it every time … . But she’s more of a winger, though, than we are.”</p><p>Besides that, the athlete’s mother supports his and his brother’s career. When he moved to Europe to play in the Austrian League, she wanted to help him settle properly.&nbsp;</p><p>However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, she could not go to Europe. Nevertheless, the mom cheers for her son all the way from New Jersey and does not miss a single game.&nbsp;</p><p>Janell’s dream is to one day see both of her sons play for the same club. With Paxten’s continuous efforts and improvements, it won’t be long before he starts receiving offers from international leagues.&nbsp;</p><h3>High School And College&nbsp;</h3><p>Initially, the midfielder attended Shawnee High School for his high school education. However, he studied there for only a year after being accepted into Philadelphia Union’s YSC Academy.</p><p>Hence, he played high school soccer and completed his high school education at YSC Academy. After that, he committed to playing collegiate soccer for the Indiana Hoosiers.</p><h2>Age, Height, & Weight</h2><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>soccer player</a> was born on October 22, 2000. Hence, he is 23 years old. Being an athlete, Aaronson is very concerned about his health and diet.&nbsp;</p><p>He maintains a balanced diet and works out daily. As a result, the midfielder is quite fit and has a toned physique.</p><p>Furthermore, he is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 150 lbs, i.e., 68 kg.</p><h2>Soccer Career</h2><h3><span class=mw-headline>Bethlehem Steel</span></h3><p>The attacking midfielder started his professional and club career with Bethlehem Steel FC in 2017.

Moreover, he was also the recipient of the 2019 MLS Rookie of the year award.&nbsp;</p><h3><span id=Red_Bull_Salzburg class=mw-headline>Red Bull Salzburg</span></h3><p>In October 2020, Philadelphia Union revealed they had sold Brenden for $9 million to the Austrian professional soccer club Red Bull Salzburg.</p><p>Similarly, the deal was one of the highest transfer fees paid for a homegrown American player from Major League Soccer.</p><p>Before the announcement, there were a lot of speculations and rumors swirling around. He joined Salzburg at the beginning of 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the athlete debuted as a Red Bull Salzburg on January 25, 2021, against Rheindorf Altach.</p><p>Besides that, he scored his first goal as a club member on February 10 in a victory against Austria-Wien. His contract with the team expires on Jun 30, 2025.</p><p>He won his first piece of silverware with Salzburg as the club defeated LASK in the Austrian Cup final by 3-0 on May 1.&nbsp;</p><h3>Leeds United</h3><p>Brenden Aaronson signed a five-year contract beginning on July 1 with Leeds United on May 26, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>He debuted for Leeds in the senior league as part of the starting eleven in their season opener on August 6, with a 2-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p><p>Aaronson scored his first Premier League goal after forcing an error from Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy winning by 3-0, helping Leeds secure their first victory over the Blues in 20 years.</p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Besides playing for clubs, Aaronson has also represented his country internationally.
