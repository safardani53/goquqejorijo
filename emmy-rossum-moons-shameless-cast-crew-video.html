During a behind-the-scenes video, fans get to watch&nbsp;her crazy antics first hand. After posing for some more conservative pictures during the season 5 Shameless photo shoot — like running from the cops and playing with fire — &nbsp;she and fellow co-stars pulled their pants down to their ankles and bared all for one final shot!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Yes, it was all in good fun — and we don’t think anyone on the cast or&nbsp;crew minded. She’s gorgeous!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>There was in fact a reason for the stunt, however. Flashing her bare butt was her character’s retaliation to&nbsp;her TV neighborhood changing; that isn’t settling well with her and the rest of the&nbsp;Gallagher family. In the shoot Emmy, <strong>Steve Howey</strong> and her TV dad,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>William H. Macy</strong></a>, unleashed their&nbsp;derrières on a restaurant full of unsuspecting customers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In the video, Emmy reveals that “The Gallaghers hate the fact that the neighborhood is getting better. I think this season’s going to be really good…. It’s the summer which is always fun. The Gallagher’s are outside and rowdy.”&nbsp;Just the way we like them!</p><h3>Emmy Isn’t A Fan Of Chicago Weather</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Emmy was such a good sport, because she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tweeted</a> out just how brisk it was on set — even with pants on!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Chicago. 20 something degrees and the first snow of the season. Nothing could be better.” She also posted that “It is 12 degrees on set in Chicago. With the wind chill it is 4 degrees. I’m all bundled up to film with Dermot Mulroney for #shameless.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>We’re&nbsp;so excited to see the chaos unfold in&nbsp;season 5 of&nbsp;Shameless!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do you think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you excited for the new season of Shameless? Do you think the Gallagher’s will be causing even more trouble in their neighborhood?</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>— Brittany King</strong></p><h3>More TV Show&nbsp;News:</h3><li><a href=#>‘Are You The One’: Jenni & John Fall Head Over Heels For Each Other</a></li><li>‘The Voice’: Luke Wade Fumbles As Top 12 Hits Stage For First Live Shows</li><li>‘Vanderpump Rules’ Recap: PUMP Opens & Kristen & Tom Get Closure</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH5ye5BxZp6lna56s7vSrKymZZ2kvK%2B%2FjKyfmqWVobK0v4ycmKysXZi%2FpsOMr6CdnZ9k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-erin-andrews-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Erin Andrews Dating Now</span></a>
