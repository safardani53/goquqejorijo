The Real Housewives of Miami alum, 46, shares four children with her ex-husband, <strong>Scottie Pippen</strong> — sons Scotty Jr., 19, Preston, 18, Justin, 15, and daughter Sophia, 12.</p><p>“We cook. We love to bake,” the former reality star added. “My daughter <a href=#>loves to bake</a>, so literally, I gained a few pounds baking with her every day.”</p><p>Though Larsa told Us she normally has “better discipline” when it comes to food, all bets are off given the ongoing health crisis. “Lately I’m like, ‘Oh my God, who cares?’ I just have to live my best life,” she explained. “We’re baking, we’re working out together, we watch movies together. I feel like we’ve watched everything on TV. We’re gonna start making our own movies sooner or later.”</p><p>Though the Chicago native is trying to make the most of her time cooped up inside, she said she’s at her best when her diet looks a little bit different. “When I feel my best, I’m working out consistently, I’m eating clean, I’m spending great time with my kids, I’m rocking my jewelry and I’m just doing the most basic things,” she explained. “I feel like the most basic things I’ve learned make me the happiest.”</p><p>Speaking of her jewelry line, which consists of 50 core pieces including necklaces, <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a>, bracelets and rings, Larsa told Us she wants consumers to think of her creations as timeless, yet versatile. “I want my line to be beautiful jewelry that makes you feel special and makes you feel loved,” she said. “You can wear these pieces forever. It’s not something like a bag that gets dated by a new collection. These pieces are ones you can grow with.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The entrepreneur added: “I wear jewelry when I work out, I wear jewelry to lunch with my friends and I wear it to dinner. I never really take my stuff off.”</p><p>With reporting by Carly Sloane</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqWZoqiubrzIqaeepl2ZvKa%2Fza1kpqGemXqpsdFmqK6Zopa7tbXNnmSwnZmctbV5xpqgp2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-things-joe-anglim-wants-you-to-know-following-his-second-chance-send-off.html><span>←</span><span>10 Things Joe Anglim Wants You To Know Following His Second Chance Send-Off</span></a>
