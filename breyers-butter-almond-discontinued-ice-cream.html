It seems like there is an endless amount ofice cream flavors. From simple vanilla and chocolate to concoctions packed with candy and cookie bits, all ice cream is good ice cream. So when someone's favorite flavor suddenly disappears, there is usually something similar they can find elsewhere.

It was packed with vanilla ice cream, oatmeal cookie pieces, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and raisins.</p><p>This flavor was a hit in the beginning, but as customers ate more of it they noticed some flaws.</p><p>“There are small raisins and cookie chunks everywhere,” one shopper wrote in a&nbsp;<a href=#>review.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>“As I dig deeper, the cookie chunks are adding a needed balance to the base and I'm starting to settle into this one.
