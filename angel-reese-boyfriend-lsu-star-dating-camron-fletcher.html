Cam’Ron previously played for the University of Kentucky, transferring in 2021.</strong></p><p>Angel Reese and her popularity have skyrocketed in the last few months. Reese became the NCAA Champion with LSU earlier this year and was named the tournament’s most outstanding player.</p><p>The talented player, Angel Reese, didn’t even mind standing her ground against First Lady Jill Biden when she proposed to invite Iowa to the White House.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angel-reese.jpg><p>And with increasing popularity, her romantic life has also come under scrutiny. Only a few months back, she was linked with Ja Morant and, only yesterday, with <a href=# rel=noopener>NBA YoungBoy</a>.</p><p>But now, Reese and her partner <a href=#>Cam’Ron Fletcher</a> have cleared the air and have declared their love for each other. The LSU star was recently featured on his Instagram story, and we might see more of those in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><h2>Angel Reese Boyfriend, Cam’Ron Fletcher&nbsp;</h2><p>Angel Reese’s new boyfriend, Cam’Ron Fletcher, is a student at Florida State University and a star player for the Seminoles basketball team.&nbsp;</p><p>Fletcher was born on July 10, 2001, and hails from St Louis, Missouri. He has three siblings, two brothers, Jayden and Jalen, and a sister, Raven.&nbsp;</p><p>Standing at 6ft 7, Cam’Ron plays as a guard and was previously committed to the University of Kentucky. Coming out of Vashon High School, Cam’Ron was named the Missouri Basketball Coaches Association Class 4 Player of the Year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angel-reese-boyfriend-camron-fletcher.jpg><p>At Vashon, Cam’Ron was also part of the track and field and football team. A multi-sport athlete, Cam’Ron was listed as the top 100 prospects when joining Kentucky.&nbsp;</p><p>Cam’Ron only played in his freshman season, at Kentucky, before transferring to Florida State.&nbsp;</p><p>He was asked to step down by head coach John Calipari after playing only twice in his sophomore season. Cam’Ron played only eleven games with Kentucky, averaging 1.7 points and 1.7 rebounds and shot.&nbsp;</p><h3>Cam’Ron Fletcher Brother, Is A Former Collegiate Player</h3><p>The Florida State University player comes from a family that loves the game of basketball as much as he does.&nbsp;</p><p>Florida State has listed his older brother Jayden as the one to play at Harris Stowe University. But it is his other brother, Jalen, who was a basketball player at Harris Stowe.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with Kentucky Sports in 2020, Cam’Ron said his brother Jalen was a like a father figure to him. Jalen is eight years older than Cam’Ron and was the one to introduce him to the sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Jalen played a key role in gearing his brother for the big stages and would monitor his diet plan and make him follow a specific schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>The older brother also mentioned if his brother makes it to the NBA one day, he would love to continue playing an integral role in his brother’s life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Angel Reese And Cam’Ron Fletcher Relationship Timeline&nbsp;</h2><p>Angel Reese and Cam’Ron Fletcher’s romance came out in public after the Florida State basketball player shared an Instagram story, involving Angel.</p><p>Earlier today, Cam’Ron shared a video of the LSU star on his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram story</a> with Angel looking down at her phone. She tells him to stop recording, but Cam’Ron continues to do so, earning a shy smile from her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/angel-reese-and-camron-fletcher.jpg><p>Only yesterday, there were rumors of Angel Reese dating the famous American rapper, NBA YoungBoy. The social media page, <a href=# rel=noopener>Raphousetv</a>, shared the news, saying it was YoungBoy, who had flown the star basketball player to Utah.</p><p>Angel had shared the video of her sitting first class and catching a flight on her TikTok handle. She captioned the video, “When I was only supposed to be catching flights, not feelings, but now I’m in first class to see my man.”</p><p>Now it is clear, it wasn’t NBA YoungBoy, but Cam’Ron, who Angel Reese has fallen for.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCtzaCcpWWimrK0sYybprKeop6yr7CMpaquZaOprrN5w5qroqaXYrCiudGopWaenJrBpLTEq2Y%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emmy-rossum-moons-shameless-cast-crew-video.html><span>←</span><span>[VIDEO] Emmy Rossum Moons Shameless Cast And Crew Hollywood Life</span></a>
