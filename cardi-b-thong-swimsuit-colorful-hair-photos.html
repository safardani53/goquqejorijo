And that’s exactly what <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cardi B</strong></a> did in her new <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>, where she showed off her smoking hot body to kick off the summer. The 30-year-old “WAP” rapper sizzled in a cut-out, white thong swimsuit that exposed her tattoo-filled butt and waist that are both super toned. Cardi rocked her<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> long blonde hair</a> stamped with colorful crosses, that featured almost every color of the rainbow. In addition, Cardi had on a pair of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pink high heels</a>, that matched the color of her long nails.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Cardi did several poses to show off her bombshell summer-ready look. In the first image, she kneeled down and stared to the side, as <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her butt</a> popped out. In the third photo, Cardi stood in the middle of a hallway and place her hands on either side of the wall, as she flaunted her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>incredible body</a>. One of the other photos showed the “Bodak Yellow” hitmaker sticking her tongue out and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>flipping the bird</a> to the camera.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“LET ME POP IT OFF !” Cardi captioned her post, before tagging her hair stylist <strong>Tokyo Stylez</strong> and her makeup artist <strong>Erika La’ Pearl</strong>. In the comments section, Cardi’s fans praised her look, with one person even saying that she’s the “best dressed female rapper” since&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Kim</strong></a>. More fans also pointed out how great Cardi’s new hair looks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cardi-b-colorful-hair-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Cardi really has become a fashion icon, and she’s always flaunting her outfits either on Instagram or out in public. Last month, the superstar wore a gorgeous <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bright-yellow bodycon dress</a> when she grabbed dinner with her daughter, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kulture</strong>, 4, and son&nbsp;<strong>Wave</strong>, 1</a>, in New York City. Cardi added to her look with turquoise statement jewelry and gold high heels. She also carried a highly-coveted green <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hermes Birkin</a> bag in on her arms, as she held hands with her son, who she shares with her husband <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Offset</a></strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>There’s no doubt that Cardi is going to continue to turn heads with her fashion all summer long. And we look forward to seeing — and admiring — everything that she wears.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e49yZpyZopm2bq6MrZ%2BoppdiwLi1zKysoqxdmLytu9GfrKVlmJa2s3nPoaatp6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./towie-what-happened-between-chloe-and-dan.html><span>←</span><span> TOWIE: What happened between Chloe and Dan?
