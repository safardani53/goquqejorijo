She was stuck in Cologne, Germany, being bullied so severely at school she had considered suicide. Not to mention the fact the entertainment industry was relatively transphobic.
A decade on, Kim has released a critically acclaimed debut album Clarity, this week performed her first sold-out headline show in London and is considered one of the most exciting stars in pop with celebrity fans including Miley Cyrus andParis Hilton."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

A lot of kids do know and that’s a normal thing in the transgender community.</p><p>The problem is a lot of parents force their kids to live as a gender that they don’t identify with. I hated myself, I hated my body and I didn’t identify with it.</p><p>“I had surgery at 16 — it allowed me, for the end of my teens, to be a normal girl. If you believe kids, that they are transgender, they can have a happy life&nbsp;earlier. And not be suicidal. Because I was suicidal, until I got surgery.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515277175.jpg><p>Speaking on a new episode of my podcast The Dan Wootton Interview, Kim tells me: “I was always like, ‘I’m a girl, help me’.

If you believe kids, that they are transgender, they can have a happy life earlier. And not be suicidal. Because I was suicidal, until I got surgery.”</p><p>Kim’s parents understood and her mum, a dance teacher with gay and transgender friends, sought professional help from psychologists and doctors from when she was 12.</p><p>She says: “I was so lucky to have supportive parents. I feel so blessed that I got to do it as young as I did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515885699-e1567185663284.jpg><p>But what’s important about Kim is that her transition doesn’t define her.</p><p>Sure, it’s a big part of her story, but more fascinating is how she moved to Los Angeles with nothing and is now on the cutting edge of pop music.</p><p>Kim prepared herself by using her tough school years to learn how to write music on her MacBook computer.</p><p>She recalls: “I was just writing about boys that didn’t like me back. Really cheesy, but I eventually got much better and kind of wouldn’t stop.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515277803.jpg><p>She was able to afford the trip to Los Angeles after writing a jingle for laundry detergent in Germany, which helped her secure a publishing deal.</p><p>But despite making some amazing music, Kim became disillusioned with mainstream record companies in LA.</p><p>She recalls: “All the labels were just talking about me being transgender constantly and didn’t even listen to the music. All the meetings I had with them were just like, ‘How do we promote it? How do we not promote it? Can you be a pop star and be transgender?’</p><p>“All these old men would talk about my gender and I was like, ‘Ugh’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515885655-e1567185897421.jpg><p>Getting on radio playlists is also proving difficult, which is ridiculously discriminatory given the obvious quality of her tunes.</p><p>She says with horror: “I’ve had a meeting with somebody who was like, ‘If I work for you, I’m going to hell because you’re going to hell’.”</p><p>As a result, she decided to maintain control of her music, saying: “That’s the reason why I get to be transgender and an artist — I don’t think I would if I had to go with a major label.”</p><p>Kim’s main music collaborator has been Dr Luke, the controversial producer fighting for his reputation after being accused of physical, sexual and verbal abuse by Kesha.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000515884299-e1567186585104.jpg><p>Kim was forced to dial back her initial support of the super-producer after a public backlash.</p><p>During the podcast — which you can download for free by searching for The Dan Wootton Interview wherever you listen — she says: “It’s a complicated situation between the two of them. I just don’t want to include myself in that.”</p><p>Will she work with Dr Luke again? Clearly pained with the question, she says: “I don’t know. Maybe, maybe not.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN BIZARRE</h2></p><p>She is a game changer already, but Kim wants more, with the aim to have massive chart success.</p><p>She says: “I can sell out venues people with big hits can’t sell out. I’m popular on the internet and I have a loyal fan base. But I don’t feel I’m there yet.</p><p>“Hopefully I’ll drop a revolutionary-ass pop record next. I really want my next record to catch people off guard. And really do something different.”</p><h2>Pals with Miley and Paris</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000517425600.jpg><p>IT was a penis painter that ended up helping Kim become friends with <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> , one of her pop heroes.</p><p>They met in March at the birthday party of cosmetics king Francois Nars, who had hired the quirky artist as entertainment.</p><p>She says: “We were having this chat while this dude was painting a picture with his d*** and were all just staring at it.”</p><p>Kim is also tight with socialite <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, who appeared in her video for I Don’t Want It All.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000517430194.jpg><p>She says: “Paris was a huge advocate for trans girls. She loves trans girls.</p><p>“And she was like, ‘I think you’re the next <a href=#>Madonna</a>’. So it was sick.”</p><p>I really hope that Paris’s prediction is spot on, because Kim definitely has the talent to have such a stratospheric career.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Miss Spain Angela Ponce competes in the preliminary round for Miss Universe as the first ever trans contestant</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhxaGh%2FcXyVaKKipV2lsrW%2BwKxkraqRo8CqwMiopWabnJa%2FqsDYZp2apZVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-dempsey-jill-fink-relationship-timeline-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Patrick Dempsey &amp;amp; Jill Finks Relationship Timeline In Photos Hollywood Life</span></a>
