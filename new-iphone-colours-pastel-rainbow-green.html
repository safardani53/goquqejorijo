Images depicting the new iPhone in these striking paintjobs have turned up online, just days before Apple's September 10 event.
The mock-ups were published by case maker Olixar and phone retailer Mobile Fun.
They show the new iPhone's widely leaked design, with a squared-off triple camera on the back.
While Apple hasn't officially confirmed any details about a new iPhone, there's growing evidence that the leaks are correct."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That mixed colour was beautiful. I want."</p><p>And but one wise Apple fan wrote: "Pretty, but it’s a $1,200 slippery brick of fragile glass that costs a ton to repair and replace....so it’s going right into a case."</p><p>The bad news is that there's no evidence Apple is actually launching these new iPhone colours.</p><p>Apple will almost certainly unveil new iPhones next week, but their colours are far from confirmed.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Apple event 2019 – what to expect</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Here's what you need to know...</p><ul><li>The headline news is the launch of a&nbsp;<strong>new iPhone</strong>, tentatively named by fans as the iPhone 11.</li><li>In fact, we're expecting three different models to succeed last year's iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max respectively.</li><li>Rumour has it these devices will be called iPhone 11R, iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max.</li><li>We're expecting a significant camera upgrade, with top models moving to a triple-lens system on the back.</li><li>And new colours have been mooted too, including dark green and lavender.</li><li>Then there's talk of an&nbsp;<strong>Apple Watch 5</strong>, which may have been leaked by Apple itself.</li><li>This time around, we're expecting new ceramic and titanium casings, as well as a possible OLED screen upgrade.</li><li>An OLED screen gives a device like the Apple Watch a huge advantage when it comes to battery life.</li><li>Unlike regular LED-backlit LCD displays, an OLED screen has pixels that produce their own light.</li><li>This lack of need for a backlight saves energy, because individual pixels can be turned off when they're supposed to be showing black.</li><li>It means you'll get more accurate colours on-screen, but it also means the display will use less energy.</li><li>After all, much of an Apple Watch screen is already black, so turning those pixels off can save large amounts of power.</li><li>We'll probably see a whole bunch of&nbsp;<strong>new Mac</strong>&nbsp;announcements, including a new iMac Pro and Mac Mini.</li><li>There's been plenty of talk about a new 16-inch MacBook Pro.</li><li>And Apple might finally announce the shipping date for the recently launched Mac Pro.</li><li>Also high on the agenda will be&nbsp;<strong>Apple services</strong>, including the new TV+ platform and the Apple Arcade gaming subscription.</li><li>We may hear about more roll-out locations for the&nbsp;<strong>Apple Card</strong>&nbsp;credit card, potentially including a UK launch.</li><li>As always, there'll likely be a surprise or two along the way too.</li></ul><p>So when can you get the new iPhone?</p><p>Apple is a creature of habit, sticking to an obvious pattern for iPhone releases each year.</p><p>The big <a href=#>Apple event</a> is already scheduled for September 10, taking place in Cupertino, Calfironia at the Apple Park HQ.</p><p>But the iPhone won't actually arrive in stores on launch day. You'll have to wait about a week and a half to actually buy one.</p><p>Pre-orders will likely become available on Friday, September 13.</p><p>And our best guess is that the phone will turn up in your local Apple Store on Friday, September 20.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Stunning new iPhone design 'revealed' by YouTuber with dummy units</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TECH</h2></p><p>Earlier this week, The Sun revealed how Apple could be preparing <a href=#>a cut-price iPhone that costs as little as £499</a>.</p><p>Already got an iPhone?
