So, by the time they are ready to leave, you kick their crap onto their curb.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>From a Rural Girl to a Big-Time Comedian</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Morgan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;to Daily Yonder in July 2020 that her family members were diligent farm people in rural Tennessee. Her mother was a housewife wholly and solely involved in keeping the house and the farm.&nbsp;Her father owned a farm and&nbsp;operated a postal route. In addition to this, her father also built a meat processing plant in their backyard to make ends meet.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>She also mentioned that even as a child growing up in a rural town,&nbsp;she had a knack for making people laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw herself in show business ever since she could make people laugh in her school and her rather-small Tennessee neighborhood.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>I was a ham. When the insurance man would come, I’d get up on the coffee table and dance like Cher. Even when we had assemblies at school, the principal would ask me to get up and do something before it. I knew from an early age I was going to be in show business, I just didn’t know how.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The stand-up comedian enrolled at the University of Tennessee&nbsp;in Child Therapy. However, fate had something else planned for her, and she ended up getting married and having babies. According to her, she still hadn't had the "show-business" part of her career mapped out, so she became a jewelry salesperson.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ironically, her jewelry selling gig was the very thing that brought her closer to her destiny as a comic. Her door-to-door sales pitch became a way to connect with new mothers. So, instead of selling jewelry, she found herself giving advice o&nbsp;new mothers on breastfeeding and hemorrhoids, albeit with her own jolly personality.&nbsp;</p><p>In retrospect, Morgan recalls this&nbsp;as developing her comedic timing and strengthening the&nbsp;foundation&nbsp;needed to build rapport with her audience.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6GyorrNnmSmp6Kcrq95xZqkoqSpYrW2v8GapZ1lk522rbDRnqVnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-james-deckers-son-forrest-has-asthma-after-3-hospital-trips.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie James Decker's Son Forrest May Have Asthma After Hospital Trips</span></a>
