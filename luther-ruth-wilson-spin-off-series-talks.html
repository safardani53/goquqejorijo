Yes, ­definitely, if the script is right and the storyline is right.</p><p>“It’s funny. People like ­watching her because she comes in and out. If you watched a whole ­episode of her, would it be the same? I don’t know.</p><p>“I’m interested — if the script is right, yes. You’d have to make the show quite different in style though, and get inside her head.”</p><p>The project would follow the lead of upcoming BBC1 series <a href=#>Baptiste</a> — a spin-off to The Missing — starring Tcheky Karyo reprising his role as detective Julien Baptiste.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000022086834.jpg><p>And Ruth believes that a shift in equality and roles for women with the success of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s BBC1 drama <a href=#>Killing Eve</a> could help get the project off the ground.</p><p>Speaking about her character Alice, she added: “She’s a scientist, she’s incredibly intelligent.</p><p>“What does she get up to on a daily basis? She’s not like <a href=#>Luther</a>. You’d have to find a new pivot, but yes we have talked about it, and she is an amazing character. There’s still so much to dig into.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000000698288.jpg><p>“She’s delicious. Like Glenn Close playing deliciously awful baddies. I love Glenn Close. She does horrible things but you’ve got to find the humanity in these characters.</p><p>“Women are getting more chances, like with Killing Eve. It’s great to see these characters and great for us to get to play them. Baddies are such fun.”</p><p>If it’s as gripping as Luther, I’m in.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Luther bosses reveal explosive trailer for next series with a seriously moody Idris Elba</span><br><h2>READ ON FOR MORE OF ANDY HALLS' BIZARRE TV COLUMN</h2><h2>Louis The-rude</h2><p>THE closest Louis Theroux ­usually gets to naked flesh is a tour of the shower block in his hard-hitting prison documentaries.</p><p>But his latest BBC2 series sees him going a lot further.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000444666310.jpg><p>The presenter swaps his clothes for a blindfold on Sunday night’s episode of Altered States as <a href=#>topless women squirt cream and smear it on his face</a> at a sensual ­eating party.</p><p>It’s all part of a visit to Portland – the US capital of polyamory – to meet people who have multiple relationships that go further than just sex.

Plus, unlike that hit’s fictional setting, this takes us back to a time when the world really was on the brink.</p><p>On top of that, Michael Shannon’s portrayal of Israeli spymaster Kurtz is nothing short of an acting masterclass – even if he can’t quite pull off the retro look quite as well as his seductive co-stars.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Florence Pugh​ and​ Alexander Skarsgard​ star in BBC drama ​The Little Drummer Girl</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">soapbox</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>IN EASTENDERS, Hayley wants to leave Walford before the truth is revealed about Alfie being the father of her unborn child.</p><p>She calls a mother and baby hostel but is left disappointed when she’s told she can’t get a space until she has given birth.</p><p>Hayley comes up with a plan but is thwarted when the other Slaters get home early.</p><p>Elsewhere, Keegan is livid when he sees that someone has defaced Shakil’s poster.</p><p>Meanwhile, in CORONATION STREET Sinead is rushed to hospital after passing out in the toilet at work.</p><p>Seeing the ambulance, Ken insists he’ll go with her.</p><p>While she undergoes further tests, Daniel becomes aware something is wrong.</p><p>Steeling himself, Ken then breaks the news that Sinead has cervical cancer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhvZmWBcYKVaKOurJiav26%2B1K2fZq%2BZocCwuoysp6KmXaSzp3nSnqminaNiwaK4yqxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jt-woodruff-19760319-html.html><span>←</span><span>JT Woodruff (Rock Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
