I block out my DMs, I just pretend they don’t exist. It’s so difficult - you can get 100 lovely messages but that one awful one will ruin your day and it’s so difficult when that keeps happening.</p><p>“It’s really sad and it is a bit depressing - but recently I’ve been getting better.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more Fabulous stories">Read more Fabulous stories</h2><p>“The most upsetting thing is missing the kind messages from lovely people who take time out of their day to say that I’ve helped them or they wore a bikini because of my post. These lovely things are the whole reason why I do what I do on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>“I do definitely experience trolling, it's pretty horrendous knowing that there are people out there who literally hate my existence, it’s a weird world isn't it?</p><p>“There will always be someone that doesn't like you, but to be reminded of that in your own personal space is not nice - it’s really not a nice feeling”.</p><p>But while Nelly receives appearance-based trolling, she also is victim to nasty messages from trolls, slamming her for absolutely everything she does.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>She explained: “It’s so unreasonable what people say - it’s weird, random, anything and everything stuff.</p><p>“What I find the most common is comments about whatever I am posting about, whatever day I might be having, there will always be people who have a problem with it.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>FABULOUS BINGO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Get a £20 bonus & 30 free spins when you spend £10 today</a></strong></p><p>“I can literally be doing anything, whether that’s making cakes or cleaning a beach or working or going to a doctor’s appointment - whatever normal life stuff I get up to, there will always be someone that will tell me that I am doing something wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s that constant low-level of criticism that you didn’t ask for that gets tiring.</p><p>“It’s normally not very specific - I do get people that say I’m ugly or appearance-based things, but I could read that all day because it does go over my head.</p><p>“But it’s the weird trying to bring you down for being normal and living your life and doing anything, that is the strangest bit.</p><p>“It makes you question your own self - like, am I terrible for shopping in Tesco? No, of course I’m not. But people will tell you that.</p><p>“It’s one of those sad things that has happened to me for so many years. Because of the content that I post, I do put myself out there - there is not a roll on my body that the universe hasn’t seen, I accept that. So people will say things about that, because they feel like they’re entitled to.</p><p>“But I don't really hear the appearance-based stuff any more - it fully goes over my head, it’s a bit depressing when you say it out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>“It happens every day, I’m never going to be able to make it stop - it’s just one of those things, I guess it’s just part of that”.</p><p>I do get people that say I’m ugly or appearance-based things, but I could read that all day because it does go over my head.</p><p>Nelly explained that she originally started her Instagram journey after having a breast reduction, ten years ago.</p><p>But her breast journey has not been smooth sailing either. Over the past ten years, Nelly has had almost ten surgeries - taking her boobs from a size HH to now, a size 34D.</p><p>After years of struggling with the size of her breasts, Nelly was finally feeling confident with her chest and opened up about her journey with her social media followers.</p><p>She explained: “My boobs were so big - they went past my belly button if I was standing up.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was 19 when I had breast reduction surgery, and before that I didn’t even know it was an option. I thought that I was just going to have to deal with these huge boobs that caused me so much pain - I just assumed that was my destiny. Now, ten years on, I’ve had multiple surgeries.</p><p>"It took much more healing than I thought, it took years and years, and I'm still not really done with the reconstruction of those scars.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had what I hope is my last surgery earlier this year - I’ve been having surgery for ten years because the first one went really wrong”.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did Nelly want to show off her new boobs to her followers, but she also wanted to take ownership of one of her biggest insecurities - her hip dips.</p><p>She revealed that she came up with the nickname ‘the girl with the hip dips’ after struggling with the size of the indents on the tops of her legs for many years.</p><p>The social media star said: “For my whole life - my genuine biggest insecurity was my hip dips.</p><p>“It was not just the size of my body but mainly the shape - with having such prominent hip dips, it’s something that I never, ever saw anywhere, it was never in images I would see in magazines, billboards or TV.</p><p>“I genuinely believed that I had a birth deformity and that it was an issue with my body that I would need surgically correcting, because I had never seen anyone with a body like mine.&nbsp;I really thought there was something wrong with me.</p><p>“Yes, my hip dips are prominent, and to be fair, I’ve never met anyone with hip dips as stand-out as mine, but most people do have them to some extent, mine just happen to be stronger.</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with them - so when I started taking ownership of that part of my body, that was my personal big thing and once I got over that I needed to see someone being confident and powerful in this body, letting me know that it was normal, so that’s how it’s become my thing”.</p><p>But although Nelly appears confident in her social media posts and has learnt to love her body, she does still have her down days.&nbsp;</p><p>Nelly added: “I think that people would assume that I’m completely obsessed with my body, live in underwear and go to Tesco naked, because I post content in lingerie, but I think it’s like anyone, you have confident moments, you have neutral moments and you do have s**t moments.</p><p>“I can appreciate my body for what it is and what it does - sometimes I’m really feeling myself and think my body is great and love my body and other times I will struggle a bit more with the mirror. I think we always go through waves about how we feel about ourselves”.</p><p>Nelly explained that being subject to trolling on a daily basis is something that Nelly understandably finds it difficult to deal with, but luckily meets regularly with a counsellor.</p><p>She continued: “We’re judged so often, so we’re bound to have some c**p days with it.</p><p>“I’m fortunate enough to have a counsellor who I see regularly and a lot of that is helping me cope with trolling. I’m learning to live with it and learning to be ok with it.</p><p>“It’s not something I feel humans are meant to deal with - humans were not made to receive negative feedback from thousands of people - our brains can’t commute that amount of information. I struggle with the overwhelm of it all.</p><p>“The scariest bit is when you read something unkind but then you notice in the days after that that thought has stuck with you in your own thoughts.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“If you were to believe thousands of negative things that you have said about yourself, that’s when the danger really happens.&nbsp;</p><p>“Learning to just be ok with the fact that people don’t like you, because there’s nothing you can do about it. It does affect me but I’m always trying really hard to not let it affect me”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/www-instagram-com-nelly-london-776139481.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/www-instagram-com-nelly-london-776139657.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/www-instagram-com-nelly-london-776137353.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/www-instagram-com-nelly-london-776139574.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5Fpa25xY2yGcLPIq6Nmr5mptW60yKlknaGgqHqxsc6po55lpKe8rbiMnq%2Biq6Seu6h5y6itnmWSpLG6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./randal-grichuk.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Randal Grichuk net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
