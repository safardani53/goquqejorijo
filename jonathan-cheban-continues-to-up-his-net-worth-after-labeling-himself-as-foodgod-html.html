Jonathan Cheban is a self-proclaimed foodie. The manufactured celebrity, as some people would like to call him, witnessed a massive increase in his net worth after he labeled himself as the &#34;Foodgod&#34; three years ago.
Cheban loves food and does not like to be simply known as a food critic.

The former publicist has come a long way from simply being reality star Kim Kardashian’s BFF. Kardashian and Cheban have been best friends since 2011.&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span>Friendship With The Kardashian Family&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The entrepreneur made apperances&nbsp;in Kardashian's&nbsp;family reality show&nbsp;</span>Keeping up with the Kardashians&nbsp;on multiple occasions.&nbsp;Thereafter, Cheban also made appearances in many of its spinoffs. He has legally changed his name to Foodgod a few years ago.</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Cheban and the mother-of-four are hardly in the same league. The former passed out with a degree in communications from Hofstra University.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span><span>Cheban reportedly met the&nbsp;</span>SKIMS&nbsp;founder for the first time during a birthday party&nbsp;of their mutual friend where he was sitting next to her. The rest is history.&nbsp;</span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span><span><span>Cheban does not have any kind of professional culinary background, but that seems to be immaterial now. The popularity of this Instagram celebrity can be gauged from the fact that he has over&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>3 million followers</span></a>&nbsp;on the photo-sharing app.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong><span>What is the net worth of Foodgod Jonathan Cheban?</span></strong></span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span><span>The Foodgod is worth&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>about $9 million</span></a>&nbsp;as of date. Although it is a far cry from Kardashian’s whopping $780 million, the amount of money is quite mind-boggling.&nbsp;</span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span><span><span>While Cheban may not be as rich as his famous BFF, his net worth is still pretty impressive. The reality TV star demands as much as $30,000 for each appearance fee.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span><span><span>Although several people are under the impression that the owner of&nbsp;</span>KKW Beauty&nbsp;is responsible for her friend’s fame in Hollywood, they are mistaken.</span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span><span>The social media star had&nbsp;accumulated a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">massive wealth</a>&nbsp;even before he befriended Kardashian. Cheban managed a reality TV series of his own in 2010 called&nbsp;The Spin Crowd.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>He took a paycheck of around $400,000 for making an appearance in the famous reality series&nbsp;</span>Celebrity Big Brother&nbsp;in 2016. However, he could last for only six episodes before the public voted him out.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>He also clinched a multi-year and multimillion deal by agreeing to endorse BurgerIM.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span><span><span>The 47-year-old is also a restaurateur and set up Sushi MiKasa in 2012. This was the start of his entry into the restaurant business as he soon launched Burger Bandit, a burger chain in New York.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Cheban also runs Sushi Couture in Miami’s South Beach with Sushi MiKasa’s chef. All these ventures have no doubt contributed to his increasing net worth.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span><span><span>It is obvious that Jonathan Cheban is extremely business savvy and has made a lot of bucks by being on TV, as well as, from his various other businesses ranging from HD mirrors to smartphone covers.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>He also runs a website known as&nbsp;</span><span>The Dishh</span><span>&nbsp;that offers information related to food recipes and the latest cooking trends.</span></span></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze8mopZqsmJa7bq%2FHnpmapl2YvK%2FAyKesnqtdqbxuwc9mn6KrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2Ws7Wx0WajmpqVobavs4yhoKarlaGzbq3SZp2op5ScvKV6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./m1lk-teas-girlfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>M1lk.teas Girlfriend: Who is M1lk.tea Dating?</span></a>
