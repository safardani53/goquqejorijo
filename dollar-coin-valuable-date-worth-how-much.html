issue features Sacagawea, a woman who during the Clark Expedition helped explore the Louisiana territory.</p><p>But the rarest coins typically feature older dates.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what you need to look know about a dollar piece that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sold</a>&nbsp;for $2,861 online after collectors put in a total of 54 bids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON COINS">READ MORE ON COINS</h2><h2><strong>The element to look for to find one</strong></h2><p>The image on the obverse shows an image of Liberty with flowing hair.</p><p>And on the reverse, there is an eagle surrounded by a wreath.&nbsp;</p><p>The mint only produced two dates with these designs: 1794 and 1804.&nbsp;</p><p>The dates can be found at the bottom center on the obverse.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>The one that sold in the recent eBay listing has the 1804 date, which is actually the higher mintage coin in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it’s still scarce with only 160,295 of these pieces reportedly created.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that there are two key varieties with the 1804 date.&nbsp;</p><p>On the wreath, you’ll want to check and see if it has two or three leaves.&nbsp;</p><p>“To determine the variety, simply look at the leaf clusters beneath the eagle's wings -- the clusters will contain either two or three leaves,” coin specialist Ron Guth&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on the PCGS website.&nbsp;</p><p>“In terms of relative rarity, the 2 Leaves variety is approximately three times as rare as the 3 Leaves variety.”</p><p>And luckily for the seller, the dollar coin was the scarcer version.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How much could it be worth?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>As always, grade and condition play a factor.</p><p>But if you happen to find one with two leaves, odds are it will be worth thousands.</p><p>According to 1794 two-leaf sales posted by Professional Coin Grading Services, the value could range from as low as $1,947 to $105,750 in circulated grades.&nbsp;</p><p>The one in the eBay listing was certified by Numismatic Guaranty Company (NGC) in “F details”.&nbsp;</p><p>The circulated grade contains “moderate wear on many elements with heavy wear on high points,” according to NGC.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What other dollar coins are valuable?</strong></h2><p>There are of course other coins you’ll want to look out for when sorting through your spare change.&nbsp;</p><p>Namely, the 1893-S (San Francisco) Morgan Dollar, with one recently&nbsp;<a href=#>selling</a>&nbsp;for nearly $13,000 online.&nbsp;</p><p>The piece, which only has a mintage of 100,000, is worth $4,511 in average condition and could be worth $662,418 in an MS-65 grade, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">USA Coin Book</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key date is 1795, which is engraved on the draped bust dollar.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the grade, the value of the 1795 date could also depend on the variety, which includes the centered and off-center bust types.</p><p>Also, one 1795-dollar coin recently&nbsp;<a href=#>sold for $3,061</a>.</p><p>Another dollar coin to look out for is the 1872 Carson City (CC) piece.</p><p>The mintage is even lower, with just over 3,000 of those coins produced.</p><p>The piece could be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">worth</a>&nbsp;as much as $109,542 in an MS-63 grade, or $3,317 on average.</p><p>To see if your spare change is worth anything, you can check eBay by searching the full name, selecting the "sold" listing, and then toggling the search to "highest value”.</p><h2
