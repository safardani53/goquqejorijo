The only drawback? Just like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stand mixer</a>, they’re big and bulky, oftentimes occupying prime real estate on your kitchen counter or in your cabinets. They can also get expensive, with some models costing upwards of hundreds of dollars; even if you’re using one daily, that’s a serious investment. And that’s where portable blenders come up huge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As the name suggests, these scaled-down versions of their OG counterparts take up far less space and ring in at a fraction of the cost. While they generally aren’t as powerful as full-size versions, the latest models still pack a powerful pureeing punch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>“</strong>Portable blenders are an amazing invention, a quick and convenient way to get a lot of nutrients into your diet through smoothies and soups,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Haylie Pomroy</a>, health strategist and the New York Times best-selling author of The Fast Metabolism Diet. “Newer ones are more lightweight than ever before and can serve as both a blender and a drinking vessel. These are great for home if you have limited counter space, to keep at the office, or to travel with,” she adds. And again, while they generally are less powerful than the big boys, if your blending needs are simple and you’re not typically blending for a crowd, or if you travel a lot, a personal blender may be a good option for you, Pomroy points out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you narrow down your choices, here are the best portable blenders currently on the market.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nutribullet-single-serve-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Overall: NutriBullet Single-Serve Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Portable blenders and NutriBullet are somewhat synonymous at this point, as the brand makes several different options. This particular model is a top choice for Kelly Ann Petrucci, M.S., N.D., a board-certified naturopathic physician, weight loss, and anti-aging expert. She raves about how high-powered it is and its ability to pulverize superfoods worth adding to your smoothie, such as chia seeds, Brazil nuts, and leafy greens. Indeed, it has a 1200-watt motor, much stronger than most portable blenders.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also nice: A pre-programmed function with an automatic shut-off, and the fact that it comes with two different-sized cups, both that have travel lids. It also takes up very little space on the counter and is easy to clean, says Dr. Petrucci, two other "musts" when talking about portable blenders. There’s a pulse feature as well; culinary expert Catherine Smart, Co-founder and CEO of Not Just Co. says that makes it great for using to whip up pesto, chimichurri, and other sauces where you want to be able to control the texture. If you're searching for a more affordable option, this may not be your top pick, but if you want a portable blender with a powerful motor that can handle most ingredients, this is a great choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>32 ounces, 24 ounces | <strong>Wattage: </strong>1200 watts | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Electric<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hamilton-beach-personal-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Budget: Hamilton Beach Personal Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You don’t have to set aside a large sum to save up for your next favorite blender — instead, you can grab the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hamilton Beach BPA-Free Personal Blender</a>, a petite and travel-friendly blender for a great price. This slim machine is available in five different shades and includes a travel lid for easy transportation after a midday smoothie. And if your plans include hopping in the car with your on-the-go lunch, you’re set for that too, because its svelte design allows for the cup to fit into most car cup holders with ease.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since this is a relatively simple machine, there’s just one button to press to reach a satisfactory blend for any of your smoothies or shakes. But since the wattage is relatively low on this machine, you’ll find that it blends best with softer fruits, vegetables, and liquids rather than hard chunks of ice or frozen foods. But still, this personal blender packs quite a punch for its small stature. So instead of heading to an overpriced smoothie shop, save money with this Hamilton Beach model for all of the fresh smoothies you need at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>14 ounces | <strong>Wattage: </strong>175 watts | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-travel-cokunst-portable-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Travel: Cokunst Portable Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, it may be a little "extra" to pack a blender in your suitcase, but this pick is so compact and portable that you’ll barely know it’s there. Because it’s both smaller and battery-operated, it’s easy to pack and use virtually everywhere, says Petrucci, who is a fan. She also calls out the extremely affordable price and notes that it still checks all of the blender boxes, despite how affordable it is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It has six stainless steel blades and a 20,000 RPM motor, which give it plenty of blending power for fruits and vegetables, but may not suffice for those who need a high-powered blender. It has an easy, one-touch on-and-off feature and you can recharge it with a USB-C cable. One charge takes about three hours, although there are helpful indicators on the blender base that indicate how much battery power is left, ensuring that you’ll never be surprised by it dying unexpectedly. It comes with an included brush cleaner, so you can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wash it by hand</a>, but you can also pop the cup in the dishwasher.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>18 ounces | <strong>Wattage:</strong> 110 watts | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Battery</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multi-tasking-magic-bullet-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Multi-Tasking: Magic Bullet Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While you will need to clear out some cabinet space for the 11 different components that come with this set, it does greatly expand your blending horizons. So, if you’re looking for a budget-friendly option that can make more than just smoothies, this is the one. “What the Magic Bullet lacks in simplicity, it makes up for in versatility, with the ability to whip cream, chop chunky salsa, and, of course, blend up a smoothie. Who needs knife skills when you've got one of these?!” says Smart, who lists this among her top picks. Credit the fact that it comes with two different blade attachments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone who is in a creative cooking rut will appreciate that this blender comes with a recipe book for extra inspiration. Just FYI — while the cups (there are two included) are top-rack dishwasher-safe, the rest of the pieces aren’t.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>12 ounces, 22 ounces | <strong>Wattage: </strong>250 watts | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Electric<strong></strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compact-blendjet-2-portable-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Compact: BlendJet 2 Portable Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Blendjet</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I really like the BlendJet because it’s lightweight and you drink right out of the blender, so you don’t have more than one thing to rinse out,” says Pomroy of one of her top choices. “It’s great for travel or as a spare blender to have at the office,” she adds (or a studio apartment or a dorm room). To that point, it’s even cordless and charges with a USB — one, hour-long charge yields about 15 blends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also one of the more stylish portable blenders we’ve seen, available in a wide array of fun colors and patterns that are anything but basic. While this version is five times more powerful than the original BlendJet, some may still find it a little too weak to crush lots of ice or really get things super smooth, so you'll want to use a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>good knife</a> to cut fruit pieces very small. It also shouldn’t go in the dishwasher, which may be something to take into consideration if you don’t usually hand-wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>16 ounces | <strong>Wattage: </strong>Brand doesn’t specify | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Battery</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powerful-ninja-fit-compact-personal-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Powerful: Ninja Fit Compact Personal Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This Ninja is super sleek, so it fits in any bag or on a sliver of countertop, but it still packs enough power to get the job done with a 700-watt motor,” says Smart of another one of her recommendations. Indeed, the wattage (while it falls short of the 1200 watts of our overall best pick) is notably higher than the other portable blenders on this list, great if you need to regularly pulverize lots of ice or frozen fruit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The cups, lids, and blades are all dishwasher safe, a major win since the cups have some nooks and crannies around the edges that can make them hard to clean otherwise. Just keep in mind that the design requires you to hold down the cup the entire time it’s blending, as there’s no locking function.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>16 ounces x 2 | <strong>Wattage: </strong>700 watts | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Electric</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-the-beach-popbabies-portable-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for the Beach: PopBabies Portable Blender</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It's Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a blender that’s as cute as it is easy to use, look no further than the PopBabies Portable Blender. It comes in several fun colors, including blue, pink, purple, and yellow, and it’s dishwasher-safe. The blender also includes a funnel and a miniature ice cube tray that makes ice which is just the right size for this personal blender.

It’s also dishwasher-safe, so it’s easy to keep it clean and ready for your next adventure.<strong><br></strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Cup Size: </strong>16 ounces | <strong>Wattage: </strong>5 watts | <strong>Power Source: </strong>Battery</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-portable-blender></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Portable Blender</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Particularly if you’re looking for an option for travel, it’s a good idea to choose one that’s on the lighter side, suggests Pomroy. Take the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">BlendJet 2 Portable Blender</a> for example, coming in at a mere 1.52 pounds — an incredibly transportable and easy-to-store option.

Our best cordless blender, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cuisinart EvolutionX Cordless Compact Blender</a>, charges with a USB cord so you can power it up anywhere instead of needing to be close to an outlet (so you can skip the smoothie shop and make your own by the pool if you want to).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Maintenance</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Make sure all of the components of a personal blender can easily be taken apart for cleaning purposes, Smart suggests. Bonus points if the cups, lids, and blades can all be tossed in the dishwasher. However, be sure to read the fine print, because not all of our picks are dishwasher safe. The last thing you want is melted plastic or ruined blades because you tossed out those precious instructions.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Motor Power</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not all portable blenders are going to be able to blend up ice, notes Petrucci, or chop up bigger pieces of frozen fruit or leafy greens.

If you don’t find yourself needing a blender too often, a more budget-friendly option may be your best starting point. But if you are on the protein shake or green smoothie grind, it’s likely worth it to invest in a high-quality machine that may be priced on the higher end to ensure quality and longevity.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the point of a portable blender?</span></p><p>Portable blenders are an easier, more convenient way to be able to create things such as daily smoothies.
