He convinces his wife (played by Beverly D'Angelo) and children to make sure they get the perfect tree and the best decorations.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But things go seriously wrong when his strange cousin Eddie (played by Randy Quaid), and the rest of his family show up unannounced. They decide to live in their trailer outside the Griswold's house. Let me tell you: it's a real disaster... a hilarious disaster, that is.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Now that you're caught up, here's where to watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.</h2><p>If you'd like to see National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation on the big screen for the first time since 1989, now is your one and only opportunity. According to Delish, all <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AMC Movie Theaters are showing the holiday classic for $5</a> per showing. In the wise words of Uncle Lewis, "the BLESSSSSING!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>You'll be able to catch it today through Dec. 12, and like I said, it's only five buckaroos per ticket. Yes, you heard that loud and clear, folks, and if you're dying to see it like I am, make sure to check participating AMC locations and purchase your tickets <a href=# rel=nofollow>on the AMC website</a> before time runs out.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">If you want to watch it from the comfort of your couch, though, you can do that too.</h2><p>Between work, school, and all of the holiday shopping you probably still haven't taken care of, though, there's a slight chance you won't have time to see it in theaters. But luckily for all you busy bees, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is available for streaming, too.</p><p>You can watch the Griswold sulk in "the thresholds of hell" on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Prime</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iTunes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vudu</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fubo</a>. Unfortunately, it isn't currently available on Netflix, HBO, or Hulu (aka any of the streaming services I subscribe to), but don't freak out... maybe it'll be different next year.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a total must-watch this holiday season — because really — what is Christmas without cousin Eddie and the entire Griswold family? Whether you decide to see it in theaters this holiday season, or if you'd rather watch it from the comfort of your own home is entirely up to you. Just remember: "Nobody's walking out on this fun, old-fashioned family Christmas."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmq6hlp5bBpLSMp5itoZ%2Bjrq15y5qkqaefo3qktNGiqq2lkah6t63Cmquip54%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./soho-farmhouse-meghan-markle-hen-do.html><span>←</span><span>We spent a weekend at the Soho Farmhouse where Meg's hen do was and got to see how posh it really is</span></a>
