One of them is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hell's Paradise</a>, the latest anime project from MAPPA, the studio behind Chainsaw Man and <a href=#>Attack on Titan: The Final Season</a>.</p><p>As a dark and stylized psychological thriller, Hell's Paradise does well to maintain MAPPA's standard of excellence in art direction.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Hell's Paradise take place in the Edo period of Japan and follows Gabimaru the Hollow, a skilled but despondent ninja who is sentenced to death but cannot be killed, presumably due to the love he has for his wife. He is recruited alongside several other warriors to find a fabled elixir of life on the mysterious island of Shinsenkyo in exchange for a pardon for his crimes from the Shogunate.</p><p>The anime premiered on April 1 and adapts a recent manga, but is the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hell's Paradise manga</a> finished yet?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is the 'Hell's Paradise' manga finished?</h2><p>The original Hell's Paradise manga was first published in Shōnen Jump+ in Japan starting in late January 2018. It was written by Yuji Kaku, who previously worked with <a href=#>Chainsaw Man</a> author Tatsuki Fujimoto on a manga called Fire Punch.</p><p>As with most anime series, they are typically adapted from an existing manga, whether or not the source material is over. It's all too common for an anime to adapt an ongoing manga, though whether or not it will adapt the whole story is a separate issue entirely.</p><p>However, there are some exceptions where the anime adapts a manga that has already finished. Hell's Paradise finds itself firmly in that camp.</p><p>The Hell's Paradise manga ended on Jan. 25, 2021 after 127 chapters. At this point, the manga has already been collected into 13 volumes, all of which were officially released with English translations by March 2022. Not only is the manga finished, but you can head down to your local bookstore and catch up on the series already!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here's where to watch the 'Hell's Paradise' anime?</h2><p>Of course, if you enjoy animation more or if you want to check out another <a href=#>MAPPA</a> project, then you can always stick to the anime. Hell's Paradise is being simulcasted on <a href=#>Crunchyroll</a> with new episodes streaming every Saturday morning.</p><p>As of this writing, it is unknown how many episodes the anime will last. Similarly, there are no confirmed reports as to whether or not the new anime series will adapt the entirety of the manga.</p><p>Among a sea of anime shows with ongoing source materials, Hell's Paradise is rather widely accessible. Whether you want to keep up with the anime or pick up the manga to get ahead of the curve, there are plenty of ways to check out this exciting new title.</p><p>New episodes of Hell's Paradise premiere every Saturday on Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButMSlo6xloJa%2ForDIrJxmpZGjtKJ5xaKloquYmrE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-weah.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | George Weah net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
