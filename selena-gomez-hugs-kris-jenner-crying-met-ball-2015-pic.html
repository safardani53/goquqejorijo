The two coincidentally shared a flight together, Oct. 1 on their way back from Paris Fashion Week&nbsp;and Kris&nbsp;even shared a pic of them with the caption: “My travel buddy @selenagomez !!!! Great time in Paris!!! #PFW #Paris #friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It was odd timing considering Kendall and Justin had just gone on a romantic dinner date in Paris. Also, Selena tweeted the moment she landed what appeared to be a very pointed tweet at the famous momager: “Random, long flight.
