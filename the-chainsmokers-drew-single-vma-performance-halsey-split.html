But would Drew be cool with Alex putting him on blast? “Probably not. I’m like, sh*t I’m in trouble. He’s super respectful about it and it was very much not a bad thing, it was like ‘I need to focus on me and do what I’m doing right now’ and hopefully they’ll get back together.” Best of luck, guys!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think of Drew breaking up with his gf after his sexy VMAs performance with Halsey?
