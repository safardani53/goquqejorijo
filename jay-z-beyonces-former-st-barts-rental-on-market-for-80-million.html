Today, celebrities including <a href=#>Sofia Richie</a><b>, </b><a href=#>John Legend</a><b>, </b><a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a> and<strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a></strong> have been spotted frolicking on the white sand beaches. And the billionaire’s paradise is most known for its impressive villas and estates — like the newly-listed Villa Neo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jay-Z-and-Beyonces-Former-St.-Barts-Rental-Hits-the-Market-for-80-Million3.jpg><p>Sources tell Us Weekly that Beyoncé, 40, and Jay-Z, 51, once rented the $80 million home. Adding to its royal status, it’s owned by British nobility. According to reports, Scottish socialite Baroness <strong>Michelle Mone</strong>, a member of U.K.’s House of Lords, and her billionaire husband, <strong>Doug Barrowman</strong>, own the pricey property. And they’re selling because they prefer living on the water courtesy of their yacht.</p><p>Villa Neo is one of the largest villas on the French-speaking island, spanning 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and coming in at 17,000 square feet. Perched on a private hillside with picturesque views of Saint-Jean bay, Villa Neo was designed with premium finishes and luxurious amenities. Every over-the-top detail was considered, from the elevator that spans all floors, to the advanced technology that controls the 24-camera security system — ideal for those celebs seeking the ultimate privacy.</p><p>The mansion also boasts rock walls with cascading waterfalls, a conservatory courtyard lined with bamboo and palm trees, a floating glass staircase that doubles as an art sculpture and floor-to-ceiling windows framing the panoramic ocean views. Other luxe details include two theaters, a spa, a gym complete with Technogym equipment and a state-of-the-art nightclub.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jay-Z-and-Beyonces-Former-St.-Barts-Rental-Hits-the-Market-for-80-Million2.jpg><p>“Villa Neo is a case study in quality, craftsmanship and luxury.
