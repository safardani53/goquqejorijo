<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Its Lizzie Vs. Cathy Vs. Henry Hollywood Life</h1></header><section class=post-content><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/the-white-princess-recap-ftr1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-2>It’s been years since Lizzie (<strong>Jodie Comer</strong>) changed alliances from York to Tudor, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>finding love with King Henry</a> (<strong>Jacob Collins-Levy</strong>) and produced multiple heirs. But she learns that she’s not as important to her husband as securing the throne. It’s total BS, especially after all Lizzie’s gone through, but that’s the Middle Ages for you. Lizzie may think that she’s Henry’s equal, and he may have treated her that way after their marriage, but it’s sadly not true. Enter Cathy Gordon (<span class=itemprop><strong>Amy Manson</strong>)</span>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Tudors have finally captured Prince Richard (<span class=itemprop><strong>Patrick Gibson</strong>)</span>, who they’re convinced is an impostor. He’s brought to the court and made a servant, with the especially cruel detail of being forced to sleep in the King’s closet. He’s surrounded by the furs, robes, and jewels that should be his own. He shovels manure, tends to Henry, and spends his life in misery. The stakes get higher when Lady Margaret (<strong>Michelle Fairley</strong>) forces his wife, Cathy, and their infant son, Edward, out of sanctuary, and into the court. She’s told, absolutely, as soon as she walks into court, that she’ll be treated as the royalty she is, but her husband will remain a peasant. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Their son, another York rival</a>, is taken away and tended to by wet nurses.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Cathy is made one of Lizzie’s ladies in waiting, but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she quickly becomes a threat</a>. In a power play, Henry flirts with Cathy hardcore to make Richard angry. But it has the unfortunate effect of hurting Lizzie, deeply. The entire court knows that Henry is (facetiously) pursuing Cathy, and it’s humiliating. Lizzie confronts him in a tense moment, and he compares the romance (which Cathy 100% does not want) to Lizzie being in love with King Richard. It’s unfair, as she explains, because she truly loved him — and it was before she married Henry! He cruelly teases that he loves Cathy. How dare he?</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Lizzie clearly has her doubts that “Prince Richard” is actually an impostor, and may actually be her brother. Maggie (<strong>Rebecca Benson</strong>) isn’t denying now that she believes him. She’s sneaking around — she’s really bad at it — speaking to Richard, speaking to the Duchess, and pissing off Lizzie. Out of spite, Lizzie commands Maggie to be one of her ladies, despite the fact that she and her family lives in Wales.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lizzie’s changed, she’s crueler and more calculating, but she thinks everyone else is. She’s willing to hurt Maggie to retain the throne. She’s not the girl she used to be. Seeing Cathy on the floor, crying, gives her a change of heart. Lizzie does something risky, maybe too risky. She gives Maggie the key to the king’s closest, has her escort (the heavily wounded) Richard to his wife, and then she lights the room on fire! Her idea is that the court thinks Richard died in the blaze, but he’ll be able to escape with his family. She goes to him with the compromise that he must disappear forever — live on a farm or something — and find safety for himself and his child. But he disobeys, walking through fire to claim his throne once more. This battle will not end anytime soon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The White Princess airs on STARZ at 8:00pm ET every Sunday.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think Henry and Lizzie will stay together?
