Everyone’s tired of being so structured — they’re leaning into easy and effortless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While splashing out on one of these luxury brands would be fun, we’ve found similar styles for a whole lot less than their designer counterparts.

This gathered clutch throws the notion that bags should have “shape” out of the window and lends itself to a relaxed frame, fluffed up by a softly pleated exterior and sealed with a lined, metal closure. We’re loving the pebbled (faux) leather texture that this bag touts, and it even comes in a collection of five chromatic colors to compliment any outfit. It also features a thin strap so you can sling it over your shoulder as a crossbody and head out the door — turning heads with every step.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.4 x 6.3 x 3.5 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Details:</strong> Permanent crossbody strap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bisadon-dumpling-crossbody-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bisadon Dumpling Crossbody Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bisadon Dumpling Crossbody Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/szThJ7DKTTXcUIJbN4tXBBUIcrE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bisadon--dumpling-crossbody-bag-913a6ec027a04eadbe9b5f32098280e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone looking to add a pop of metal (or Barbie pink) into their wardrobe will be enamored of the Bisadon dumpling clutch. These bags are made from textured faux leather to add extra dimension to their already abstract shape, ensuring that this bag will always catch the light no matter where it’s toted. You can even get these styles in a small or medium size, which offers more options for personal wear (the medium bag for those days when you have a ton of things to carry, and small for a nano purse moment). The strap is another advantage, as you can adjust the length for a shoulder or crossbody bag style, or completely remove it for a night-out clutch. The possibilities? Endless.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.3 x 1.6 x 4.3 inches (small), 14.6 x 3.5 x 7.9 inches (medium) | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Details:</strong> Detachable adjustable strap, various sizes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cluci-dumpling-shoulder-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cluci Dumpling Shoulder Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cluci Dumpling Shoulder Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rGQWOApY8jhCXgP9FCHB3PpaDwA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cluci--dumpling-shoulder-bag-570cac9acc8a48239b8efbb73a9535b2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shoulder bag lovers, rejoice — we just found the perfect version of the dumpling bag trend for you. Complete with a shoulder strap and vegan leather body, this slim purse takes a twist on the dumpling style with a gathered bottom. Its exterior is separated into two panels and ruched along the hemline to form the pillowy silhouette that we love and closes with a zipper for extra security. You can even adjust the length of the shoulder strap with a buckle along the side, which allows it to be as short or long of a strap as you desire. And did we mention that it comes in nine pastel and neutral shades, plus one version in cheetah print? It doesn’t get better than this.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12.9&nbsp; x 1.1 x 7.8 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Vegan leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Details:</strong> Adjustable strap, zipper closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-drop-womens-janelle-gathered-shoulder-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Drop Shoulder Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Drop Women's Janelle Gathered Shoulder Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/lymyUoU7na4bgPc4NbpWdXiHuFM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-drop-womens-janelle-gathered-shoulder-bag--548f189b80c34fb096aa7ec002d72e8a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sticking with the shoulder bag theme is the Janelle Croissant from Amazon’s The Drop, a faux leather (smaller-scale) tote that looks far more expensive than it actually is. This slouchy bag features a gathered design and seals together with a snap closure, keeping your items safe in the deep pocket of this bag while you go about your day. While the bag itself is quite bigger than some of the others we’ve looked at, it can certainly hold more — making this a great option for people who need a bag that can hold everything they need from day to night (while still looking impossibly chic). Snag it in three colors, tan, black, and light gray, for an everyday bag that will elevate any outfit.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15.25 x 9.75 x 3 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Details:</strong> Shoulder strap, snap closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-naariian-pu-leather-dumpling-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Naariian PU Leather Dumpling Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Naariian PU Leather Dumpling Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AZPMww7LcUEGvcnb9hUB9RI-adw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/naariian--pu-leather-dumpling-bag-ac348f0fa1ac45ac91178df6bd747bff.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re headed on a vacation or a date, it’s fun to bring along an untraditional purse that adds a bit of texture to your outfit — and that’s exactly what this woven pouch provides. Its crosshatched design feels reminiscent of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bottega Veneta mini leather pouch</a>, just at a much lower price. We appreciated the several colors that it came in, from punchy pastels to silvery chromes, and liked that its straps were removable (and that it even came with a detachable chain strap, if you wanted it to be a little dressier). This is the perfect woven option for someone looking for a pouch bag rather than a shoulder style.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 6.1 x 2.7 x 5.9 inches. | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyurethane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 14 | <strong>Details:</strong> Removable and adjustable straps, additional detachable chain</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-uniqlo-u-drawstring-shoulder-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo U Drawstring Shoulder Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Uniqlo U Drawstring Shoulder Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pSeiCV0UqJ-q7hqim6xBNGe87mI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uniqlo--u-drawstring-shoulder-bag-bca99cc11a844943b49fb3cf74529a32.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Uniqlo&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those old drawstring bags you used to wear to gym class? Yeah, they’re back — just in a much cooler, crossbody style. These slouchy bags from Uniqlo give a new meaning to the name “dumpling bag” with its cinch-top closure and single carrying strap, which replaces the backpack drawstrings from ye old days of P.E. class and college orientation. It features an inside zipper pocket and has a little more functionality than the others we’ve looked at thanks to its dimensions, which are large enough to fit a laptop, wallet, and even a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reusable water bottle</a> (basically a bookbag). For the student or busy commuter, this bag is the ideal way to incorporate this hot trend.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 44.5 x 19.3 x 23.6 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, cotton, nylon | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Details:</strong> Drawstring closure, adjustable crossbody/shoulder strap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-charles--keith-ruched-hobo-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charles & Keith Ruched Hobo Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charles &amp;amp; Keith Ruched Hobo Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YZcGLvs0V4UMvbU4Y6IDYpDkIQc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charles--keith--ruched-hobo-bag-86ca3f7ec7694d38be3d55f2054d49bd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charles & Keith</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Need just a bit more space in that dumpling bag of yours, but don’t want to lose the adorable pouch look? This ruched hobo bag from Charles & Keith checks all of those boxes, featuring a nearly 15-inch long body with a wide-capacity inside to hold all of your essentials. There’s even a zipper pocket inside to keep your keys and wallet extra safe as you zip around, and a snap closure to secure all the rest. We love its cinching straps that decorate the hemline of the bag, which you can pull to cinch the top taut into a plush dumpling shape before slinging it over your shoulder. And it comes in baby blue and black — need we say more?<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11 x 14.76 x 11 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Details:</strong> Shoulder strap, cinch closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-verdusa-ruched-small-clutch></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Verdusa Ruched Small Clutch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Verdusa Ruched Small Clutch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0XRmZskPsFILfCx75mJBe648CIE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/verdusa--ruched-small-clutch--4ece47e479fd4ce88c3bd9a1dc75906f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes you need a purse in between a shoulder bag and a clutch, but where do you find such a thing? Behold, the Verdusa pouch bag — a delicately gathered, faux leather bag with an acrylic handle and several color options. Teetering the line between a clutch and a wristlet, this teeny bag (and we do mean teeny, it’s just 5 x 9 inches), can snugly fit a phone, card holder, and a lipstick or two inside before snapping shut at the top. It’s available in two colors in a smooth, leather-like material, two crosshatch fabrics, and one metallic faux-croc fabric. When your outfit is needing one last statement piece, you can add this tiny purse as functional jewelry.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.9 x 2.2 x 5 inches (not including handle) | <strong>Material:</strong> Faux leather, polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Details:</strong> Round handle, snap closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-charles--keith-ally-ruched-slouchy-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charles & Keith Ally Ruched Slouchy Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charles &amp;amp; Keith Ally Ruched Slouchy Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4nCdVUmXCNQu6bhobYqq_xMoVhE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/charles--keith--ally-ruched-slouchy-bag-6a089283b7b84e9bb8f54203159357a9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charles & Keith</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These gathered bags have the tendency to make your ‘fit look a little dressy without even trying — so in order to get the most use out of your dumpling bag, you may want to go for something like the Charles & Keith Ally. This slouchy bag comes with a comfortable shoulder strap and ruched opening, which can be magnetically closed to protect your belongings. Its plush material is accented by a conjoining center seam, which draws your eye to its dumpling-esque top and elevates this otherwise traditional shoulder bag. Whether you’re dressing up your jeans-and-a-tee outfit to run to the store or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>toting this bag to work</a>, you’ll be sure to stand out in a sea of drab bags.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.27 x 3.15 x 5.9 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Faux leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Details:</strong> Adjustable and detachable shoulder strap, magnetic closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-madewell-the-piazza-crossbody-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Piazza Crossbody Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Piazza Crossbody Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/cIQi-YMDuwhHYMh4LfLH3uI62NY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell--the-piazza-crossbody-bag-5afaffd521404ee79afa89c6515bae73.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If crossbody bags are the name of your game, then you’ll love what the Piazza bag from Madewell has to offer. Its boxy shape is still able to be cinched at the top, giving it the slouchy look that we know and love. Plus, its leather material makes for a supple, shiny surface that catches the light with every pleat and pucker. But what’s even better about this bag is the ability to pack a ton of all-day essentials into it — from phones to wallets, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup products</a>, and more.

She recommends the Nothing Written Black Nella Bag as an everyday bag that can go with any outfit and slide right into anyone’s wardrobe thanks to its neutral shade and simple design. While the lambskin leather that constructs this bag makes it look far more expensive than it is, the stylist was drawn to this style for its versatility.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I always recommend my clients invest in what's right for their lifestyle as well as pieces that can easily rotate with various looks in their closet,” she says.

So whether you have a wedding or an especially fancy date night in your future, you may want to turn your attention to this quilted dumpling bag from Mango. This crossbody is decked out in elegant, faux leather pleats and a delicate chain strap, and available in an ivory and gold combo or all-silver facade, depending on your preference.

It sounds like a figment of your imagination, but it’s really just the Mini Chiara Convertible Bag from Reformation. This small bag can be worn differently depending on which way you have it closed — whether that’s open (creating a V-shape) with the drawstring laying loosely or drawn taut, molding the bag into a dumpling shape. Two ways to style, two funky silhouettes, and one price for a bag that can be worn in several different ways.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 6.5 x 2 x 5 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Nappa leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 10 | <strong>Details:</strong> Drawstring, wristlet strap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-clare-v-emma-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clare V.

Volpe describes this pouch as “flirty, young and fresh for a festive dumpling bag,” lauding its shamrock hue for its wearability. “It's a knockout transitional color from spring to summer and summer to early fall,” she says. Made to fit a phone, keys, your wallet and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your favorite lippie</a>, this bag is all you need for a day on your feet.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.5 x 5.25 x 7 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Lambskin, chambray | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Permanent straps, drawstring, snap closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jcrew-santorini-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Santorini Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Santorini Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y5Q2ya9lpzbxe7Y5nhr0ekMX8IM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/J.Crew-Santorini-Bag-2b8cdcfee304444fb66868a6d4b6f9ae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Because of its crystal-encrusted facing, this purse won’t be the best option for someone looking for an accessory for day-to-day things, like running errands or going to the office</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some bags should be functional enough to take on your day-to-day life, but others should be a little more fun — and this crystal-studded bag from J.Crew is the perfect way to tie together a black-tie ensemble. Volpe recommends this style because it’s basic enough to fit many upscale outfits, but not so outlandish that it detracts from the rest of your outfit. Think of this sparkling wristlet as an extension of your jewelry, dangling from your wrist like an elaborate bracelet (that can conveniently carry all of your night-out essentials in).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5.5 x 3.5 x 8 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Fold-over carrying handles, snap closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-other-reasons-clutch></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>8 Other Reasons Clutch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="8 Other Reasons Clutch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4UFk9ajShyyxOKy2EoD_riGLs2c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/8-Other-Reasons-Clutch-3f68042a40f845178edd6966a9f6242e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyone in need of a party purse?

She credits pinks, blues, greens, and golden chromes as a colorful way to modernize your purse collection while embracing the trendy dumpling bag silhouette.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 13.75 x 2.5 x 8.5 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Faux leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Magnetic closure, detachable and adjustable shoulder strap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-craftsleathers-dumpling-cloud-handbag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CraftsLeathers Dumpling Cloud Handbag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CraftsLeathers Dumpling Cloud Handbag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UB8kpvVS4BAbVYivexEumcZxy0c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/craftsleathers--dumpling-cloud-handbag-329c09b7f5c8414ebf2aff5e76538dd9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Etsy</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>You won’t get much in terms of interior storage, like pockets, so this won’t be preferable to an organizationalist.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No, your eyes don’t deceive you — this bag is shockingly similar to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bottega Veneta Mini Pouch</a> that we often see Kendall Jenner sporting. From its gathered closure to its cinch straps and long, monochromatic strap, this purse bears a striking resemblance to its luxury lookalike, just at a much lower price. We appreciated this bag’s upscale look without the price tag to match, and loved the option to choose from a variety of colors: autumnal shades like wine, green, and black, to name a few. If you have designer taste but not the designer checking account to match, then this bag could be the one for you.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.66 x 2.75 x 5.11 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Faux leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Details:</strong> Shoulder strap</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Diggzy / Jesal / Shutterstock</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rebecca-minkoff-ruched-faux-leather-clutch></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rebecca Minkoff Ruched Faux Leather Clutch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rebecca Minkoff Ruched Faux Leather Clutch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QTmjQAxyKAnExC85S-bfDalJqVs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rebecca-minkoff-ruched-faux-leather-clutch-24996552c64f4268b69a59296e665851.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Taking a traditional spin on the modern dumpling bag is Rebecca Minkoff’s faux leather clutch, a sleek, gathered bag that features intricately woven fabric and a statement tassel. Its deep and spacious interior features a zippered pocket and the bag can be securely fastened by the tassel-adorned outer zipper, which matches the bag’s dusty lilac shade. Its crosshatched weave bears a slight resemblance to the Bottega Veneta Teen Pouch that model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley often dons, which makes us love this stylish pouch even more. Pair your clutch with your best tweed suit set or use it as your statement piece to dress up a casual evening outfit.

This teeny bag is only 6 by 6 inches, but its silhouette is up to you, thanks to the adjustable drawstring. You can choose to wear it cinched like a true dumpling bag or open for the full bucket effect, and sling its long, knotted straps over as a crossbody or wear it like a shoulder bag. Plus, it’s made with buttery genuine leather and lined with ultra suede, a purely polyester interior, for a superior look and feel. This is surely the dumpling bag in its final, grown-up form.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 6 x 6 x 25 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, suede | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Details:</strong> Drawstring closure</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cult-gaia-zabelle-shoulder-bag></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cult Gaia Zabelle Shoulder Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cult Gaia Zabelle Shoulder Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BU56rqUIOeJs_trxc48g-sV9Niw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cult-Gaia-Zabelle-Shoulder-Bag-40218fb76ff5411db08fddb5fd9e9cc7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cult Gaia</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for something a little more structured and suitable for everyday use (without being boring), this Cult Gaia bag is the perfect contender for the job.

Volpe highlights this bag for its versatile shade, calling it the “perfect bag” for things like the office or a casual brunch. “Neutral tones create an elevated, chic, and timeless look which is easy to pair with anything — from your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>oversized boyfriend-jeans</a> to your ultra-feminine lace mini,” she says. Its unique, strappy accents, recycled materials, and general versatility make this bag one we wouldn’t think twice about splurging on.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.8 x 4.9 x 5.5 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Recycled leather | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Details:</strong> Interior organizational compartments, magnetic closure, card pocket, detachable and adjustable shoulder strap</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-look-for-before-buying-dumpling-bags></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Look for Before Buying Dumpling Bags</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Construction</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As with any bag, a few things you’ll want to keep in mind as you search for that perfect dumpling bag are the design features that make up your pouch. From interior pockets to closures and more, there’s a myriad of features that make each bag unique. Bags like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Uniqlo U Drawstring Shoulder Bag</a> are more functional, offering interior zipper pockets and a fold-over closure (plus a ton of space inside) for all of the things you need, whereas the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Banana Republic Pietra Bucket Bag</a>, with its lax drawstring closure and small interior, is a bit more for show (though you can certainly stow your wallet and phone inside).&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no set fabric that these kinds of bags are made from, as this gathered look can be achieved with so many different kinds — from leather to tweed and so many in between. But more flexible fabrics are often the ones that designers will reach for to achieve the most pillowy look. “I like a dumpling bag to be slouchy and any soft material like suede or leather,” says Elisabeth Kassab, the creator of StylistCheck. “To literally look like a dumpling!”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A “dumpling bag” is the loose term we’re coining these slouchy bags with, because these styles really do come in endless shapes and sizes. From seashell-like clutches (think: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Rebecca Minkoff’s Ruched Faux Leather Clutch</a>) to softly-pleated baguette bags, there’s a world of dumpling-esque options out there for you. It’s also important to take into consideration the way you wear your bags — whether you prefer crossbody styles, large carry-all bags, or clutches that can be transformed with a detachable strap. After all, versatility is key.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m seeing lots of circular styles and top handle dumpling bags — very small in size as well,” Kassab says.
