An elementary school student wore what he thought at the time to be a McDonald’s shirt. Honestly, he was probably just sleepy and grabbed a shirt that fit.
Unfortunately, the intensely lewd shirt was a parody … one that went right over his head."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

One might infer that the implied woman is wearing nothing save a pair of heels.</p><p>In other words, the shirt advertises sex with a woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>McCullar offers an apology — and an explanation.</p><p>"Once again, my sincere apologies to the teachers and staff at Travis Elementary. I promise from now on to monitor what my kids are wearing!"</p><p>Obviously, some parents go overboard when it comes to rigidly controlling what their children (who are people!) wear. But, in this case, this is not a shirt that should be worn by an elementary school student.</p><p>"I had no idea Anthony wore this to school!!"</p><p>Of course. Plenty of parents are busy. And if it’s cold, you might never see their undershirt.</p><p>"Just to clarify, I would never let my kid wear something like this."</p><p>Few parents would.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>She explains how this came to pass.</p><p>"A friend had given me some hand me down clothes for Anthony."</p><p>Clearly, this boy is not the only one who didn’t notice that the shirt was inappropriate.</p><p>"I haven’t had the chance to completely go through them. I will tonight though!!"</p><p>We’re sure that she did.</p><p>"Through my embarrassment, I did&nbsp;[laugh my ass off]!!"</p><p>She finished that with a couple of tags:</p><p><span class=_5afx><span aria-label=hashtag class="_58cl _5afz">"#</span><span class=_58cm>ithoughtitwaslikemcdonslds&nbsp;</span></span><span class=_5afx><span aria-label=hashtag class="_58cl _5afz">#</span><span class=_58cm>notthegoldenarches</span></span>"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Our favorite part about this story might be that … no one seemed to notice.</p><p>The boy didn’t notice, because even if he thinks about girls in that context, he’s just not old enough to immediately connect his shirt’s logo to sex.</p><p>But it seems that no teacher noticed, either.</p><p>We live in a world where girls are sent home because their sleeves are too short, flaunting their sinful shoulders which will surely leave boys too enthralled to concentrate in class.</p><p>And yet … not one teacher commented on this boy’s shirt.</p><p>There are two possible explanations.</p><p>The first is heuristics. It’s how the human mind processes sensory information, valuing efficiency over accuracy. His shirt has the colors and general shape of a McDonald’s logo, so it may register automatically as that to a teacher who has twenty-plus other students.</p><p>As the child says, "they thought it was like McDonald’s too."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That said … it’s also possible that a teacher noticed but was simply too embarrassed to call attention to it.</p><p>Teachers and administrators will absolutely do that. They’ll see something that violates school policy but they’ll make a judgment call to pretend that they didn’t see it.</p><p>This child is clearly so innocent that he had no idea what he was wearing. A teacher didn’t want to be the one to explain sex to a kid without his parent’s permission.</p><p>Also, calling attention to it would mean that other students would be involved. There’s no good solution there … except to pretend that you never noticed.</p><p>See Anthony’s awkward, adorable explanation in the video:</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8rrvToZyrZZGlvK27xqKxnqtdlrO1sdFmn56qXa68trrGZqqopl2ssqK%2B0majnq%2BUYrqksM6nmKWco2K9or7OnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jaime-pressly-arrested-for-dui.html><span>←</span><span>Jaime Pressly Arrested For DUI</span></a>
