The leaves are turning amber and crunchy, the air is getting crisper, <a href=#>pumpkin spice</a>-flavored goodies are stuffing grocery store shelves, sweaters are being plucked from the backs of closets, pumpkins and mums are popping up on front stoops — shall we go on? <a href=#>It's fall</a>, y'all. And when the clock strikes midnight on Oct. 1, spooky season will officially begin!</p><p>However, this didn't stop Disney Plus from releasing Anne Fletcher's witchy flick <a href=#>Hocus Pocus 2</a> on Sept. 30, 2022. We just couldn't wait until October to watch the long-awaited sequel to Kenny Ortega's <a href=#>Hocus Pocus</a>. Despite the OG being severely panned by critics in 1993, over the years Hocus Pocus has solidified itself as a deliciously campy cult classic, one that we can't help but turn on every Halloween season.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For those who don't know, Hocus Pocus follows child-hungry witches Winifred (<a href=#>Bette Midler</a>), Mary (Kathy Najimy), and Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker) — aka the Sanderson Sisters — as they return to Salem in 1993, plotting their revenge on the town 300 years after they were hanged. How? Well, skeptical virgin Max Dennison (Omri Katz) couldn't help but light the infamous Black Flame candle on <a href=#>Halloween</a> night, summoning the enchantresses in the process. Along with his spunky little sister, Dani (Thora Birch), and his sweet crush, Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max must find a way to stop the evil sisters before dawn.</p><p>In celebration of the sequel's splendid arrival, here are some spooky Hocus Pocus-inspired <a href=#>cocktails</a> to set the tone. Boasting glitter and magic, think of them as cutesy alcoholic potions. And don't worry, neither the blood of thy enemy nor a piece of thy own tongue are required ingredients.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This blue-hued witch's brew is utterly enchanting.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Boasting 2 oz. of Empress 1908 Gin, 1 oz. of blue Curaçao, 1 oz. of lemon juice, and a bit of soda water, this witch's brew is hair-raising in all the right ways.</p><p>"It tastes like a Tom Collins basically, but spooky," TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@bestdayoftheweek</a> shared.
