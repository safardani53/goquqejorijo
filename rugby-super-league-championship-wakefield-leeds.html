Things that make players feel valued and that they’re in a professional environment.</p><p>“But that’s the tip of the iceberg. A few things are happening in terms of the players’ areas the boys will be blown away with. They’ll make sure we’re working in an elite environment, which is what we all want.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN RUGBY LEAGUE</h2></p><p>“Players want to see someone who wants to take the club up to the very top and not accepting of poor standards.</p><p>“And that’s where Wakefield is going, I can’t say how exciting it is if I’m honest.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby League</h2></p><p>Ellis, a fan and sponsor who took over from John Minards and Michael Carter, added: “I found a club that needed work, parts of which were a little run down and needed some investment and energy putting into them.</p><p>“As well as the chef, we’ve already moved the training base – with the long-term vision of having our own. We’ve redone the players’ social area and we’re even looking to improve the club coach that takes us to games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/matt-ellis.jpg><p>“The Western Terrace isn’t right, the boxes in the ground haven’t been touched for 20 years and I’m not 100 per cent happy with the new stand. It needs further work to bring it to the level we expect.</p><p>“Redoing some of the facilities is critical for the players and supporters. You can put money into it but you’ve got to have a facility top players want to play at.</p><p>“I talk straight – I don’t hide away. I talk ambitious, maybe a bit too ambitious and put pressure on ourselves, but that’s where Daryl and I want to be. We want to be at the top end of Super League, so let’s aim for it.”</p><p>Wakefield will show how they are coming together on the field when they face Leeds in Tuesday’s traditional trial match.</p><p>As well as keeping the best of last season’s squad, Trinity have added the likes of former England winger Jermaine McGillvary and the prolific Lachlan Walmsley, with Ellis’ investment keeping them full-time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/1_Wakefield-Trinity-are-pleased-to-announce-that-Daryl-Powell-has-been-appointed-as-our-Head-Coach-for.jpg><p>And Powell – quick to point out he was born in nearby Ackworth despite his Castleford connection - revealed how former boss Applegarth played a part.</p><p>He added: “I found a good group of blokes on the playing side. I sat down with Mark and he told me he felt like he’d got rid of all the players he felt didn’t want to be at the club. He was proved right.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“And the work that Matt’s done, along with his vision, is something you couldn’t help but get grabbed by.</p><p>“If the group of players isn’t ready to change, you can’t do anything. I saw a group of people that wanted to change and be successful. That’s why it’s such an exciting place to be at.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH92fZFtcG1sX6fCqK7YZqquqJWneq2xwKCsnmWTna6uvMiopaygmaV6uK3Knp2inZyZeq2xxJ2qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carly-pearce-dating-history-5183865.html><span>←</span><span>All About Her Ex-Husband and Love Life Hollywood Life</span></a>
