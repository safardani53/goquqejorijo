Photos captured the actor taking a stroll in Los Angeles,&nbsp;California, on Tuesday.
In them, Jack dressed casually in shorts and a SAG-AFTRA T-shirt, showing his support for the ongoing writers' strike. He paired the look with tan shoes, high socks, glasses, a wide-brimmed hat, and his long salt-and-pepper beard.
