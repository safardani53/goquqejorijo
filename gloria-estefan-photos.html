Two years later, she moved to Miami, Florida with her family as they fled the Fidel Castro regime. The U.S. would become her home and the place where she launched her multi Grammy Award-winning career. Gloria became a household name in the 1980s storming up the pop charts with hits like ‘Get On Your Feet’, ‘Rhythm Is Gonna Get You’ and ‘Conga’ as a solo artist and part of the Miami Sound Machine. Throughout her career she has sold more than 100 million records worldwide. She has been married to her musical collaborator, producer Emilio Estefan since 1978. They have two children together. Their son Nayib was born in 1980 and their daughter Emily arrived in 1994, four years after Gloria survived a terrifying near-death tour bus accident. Despite breaking her back she learned to walk again and resumed her career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLStu9GimGado6myp63NZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-trey-azagthoth-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Trey Azagthoth Dating Now</span></a>
