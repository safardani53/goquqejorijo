After <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills </a>bombshell<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;<strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></a>, 50, accused Yellowstone actress <strong>Piper Perabo</strong> of having <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an affair</a> with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ex-husband</a> back in 2005, the actor provided a straightforward statement completely denying it. “I’m sad I have to address this, I really believed that we had come a long way, but this was untrue 19 years ago and it’s untrue now,” Eddie told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> via his rep on Tuesday, Dec 20. “Just because someone thinks something might be true does not make it true. This is all so unnecessary. Fun times at the Christmas table await.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Eddie-Cibrian-Brandi-Glanville-Affair-Piper-Perabo-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Earlier in the day, Brandi slammed Eddie, 49, who is now married to country icon <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LeAnn Rimes</a>,</strong> 40, with quite a hefty allegation during an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>, stating they were “f***ing” in 2005. “They did a movie together<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> and [my son]</a> <strong>Mason</strong> was 1 year old and I went to the set and it was in another country, Romania, I think,” Brandi claimed in the interview, also published Dec 20. The reality star also claimed that Piper was “a horrible c***” to her and that Eddie and Piper were “flirtatious” in the open.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“She was flirting with Eddie, like, right in front of me,” she alleged. “I was like, ‘Am I here? Am I the only person [seeing this]? Like, what is happening?’” Brandi claimed the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>alleged infidelity</a> occurred as the two actors worked together on the 2005 set of The Cave.&nbsp;“I made friends on set and I heard a lot of things,” she told the outlet, adding that crew members told her that, “Piper and Eddie were f***king.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Eddie-Cibrian-Brandi-Glanville-Affair-Piper-Perabo-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>This isn’t the first time Brandi has aired her grievances about her marriage with Eddie, with whom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she shares sons</a> Mason, now 19, and <strong>Jake Cibrian</strong>, 15. The former couple were married from 2001, 2010, and Eddie famously went on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to marry LeAnn</a> — but an insider told us in April of 2020 that it’s been a struggle between the blended families. “LeAnn, Eddie and Brandi do the best they can to get along, but they will never be the best of friends,” a source<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> told<strong> HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY</a> for the report. “They don’t really get along, but Brandi is more outspoken about things than LeAnn and Eddie because that’s Brandi’s personality. She’s no BS and tells it just like it is. They’ve come a really long way, but they live very different lives and struggle to get along properly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FpZp6clJ6ybq%2FIm6mimZ5iv6atwq2qZqiZpbKzec%2BeqZqan2Kup7LAoqlmmqKWu6W1jKCjmqamnrmtsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bethenny-frankel-posts-unedited-bikini-pics-talks-harm-of-filters.html><span>←</span><span>Bethenny Frankel Posts Unedited Bikini Pics, Talks Harm of Filters</span></a>
