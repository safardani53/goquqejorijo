Punters made their way to The Croydon Hall Hotel in Exmoor to join the late-night adult party which has eight “playrooms” which were set up for a variety of kinky tastes.
One is called The Red Room and is said to contain S&M gear including whips, paddles and a sex swing.
The venue is currently being investigated by the Exmoor National Park Authority over concerns it may not have the correct planning permission for its parties."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We are disturbed on and off for three hours in the middle of the night.”</p><p>Mr McCloud denied claims his guests were disrespectful to the neighbours and said he had soundproofed the building.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Times</a>: “You have to have a special licence for sex things if you are selling anything sexual, like DVDs, but this is just a hotel. It's basically Disneyworld for adults.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in UK news</h2></p><p>“What people do in a hotel is up to them. They hire the venue for an evening where they have a dancefloor, a bar, and if they want to go up to the playrooms and have some fun, they can go and do that.</p><p>“We went from eight to twelve couples and at our last party we had 75. We've got doctors and a barrister who comes. They are quite well-to-do and we have some nice sports cars parked outside. We're a high-end club.”</p><p>The district council is set to discuss Mr McCloud’s licence application on Monday April, 29.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485060946.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Outrageous Naked News presenter Carli Bei strips totally NUDE to visit a swingers party in Jamaica</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbYZ2hJJqbGirp567qLHRrGScpKWXerG4wLKpqKedqHqwvsayZKWnk5a5tHnAp56eql8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ahs-evan-peters-flashed-balls-jessica-lange-video.html><span>←</span><span>Evan Peters Flashed His Balls To Co-Star Jessica Lange Hollywood Life</span></a>
