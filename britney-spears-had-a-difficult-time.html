<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Britney Spears Had A Difficult Time As A Result Of Her Recently Concluded Conservatorship</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Britney Spears</strong>, the American pop sensation, is preparing to publish her biography. According to the news site Page Six, the 40-year-old singer has signed a multi-million dollar book contract. Insiders in the publishing business said Spears had landed an enormous contract with Simon & Schuster for her book. It is planned to discuss her career as a musician, her life, and her tumultuous connection with her family. According to a source, the publishing firm won the agreement following a bidding battle with many other publishers for her book. He said that the transaction was one of the “largest of all time, second only to the Obamas.”</p><p>In 2017, the rights to Barack and Michelle Obama’s books were sold for more than $60 million. The highest price ever paid for non-fiction works. Bill Clinton accepted a $15 million contract for his post-presidential biography, My Life, in 2001. Spears had planned to write a memoir after being outraged by the changes made in her younger sister’s book Things I Should Have Said, which was published in January 2022.</p><h2>Britney Spears had a difficult time due to her recently concluded conservatorship.</h2><p>Britney Spears’ book agreement comes months after she battled for her release from a 13-year-long court-ordered conservatorship imposed by her father, Jamie Spears. Conservatorships are often conferred to elderly or infirm persons who cannot make their own choices. Following a time of mental illness, Spears’ conservatorship was created in 2007. Rumors circulated that the singer was being kept against her will under a conservatorship, sparking the #FreeBritney campaign.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Britney-Spears-1-2.jpg alt="Britney Spears" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Britney Spears delivered her first public evidence concerning the conservatorship in 2021, according to The Guardian, telling a Los Angeles court that she was forced to work without breaks despite pleading for them. The actress also discussed how she could not handle her money and was denied the ability to marry her lover despite her desire for a third kid.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“I’ve been taken aback. I’ve been traumatized. “All I want is my life back.”</p><p>In September 2021, a court halted her father’s conservatorship, which was abolished in November 2021. Following that, Spears remarked that her family members “should all be in prison” for her “demoralizing and demeaning” behavior.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Britney-Spears-3.jpg alt="Britney Spears" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Britney slammed her sister Jamie’s book.</h2><p>Britney Spears reportedly rebuked her sister Jamie Lynn for accusing her of mental health issues on Good Morning America. Jamie Lynn alleged Britney once trapped her and her companion in a room with a knife. She also characterized the singer’s conduct as “erratic, paranoid, and spiraling” throughout the years. Britney took offense and accused her sister of marketing the book at her cost. Consequently, Britney’s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, wrote Jamie Lynn a cease-and-desist letter, informing her that his client would no longer be bullied by her family members. The letter stated:</p><p>“While Britney has not read and does not plan to read your book, she and millions of her fans were surprised to discover how you have used her for financial benefit.” She will not, and should not, put up with it.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Britney Spears has finally unfollowed her ‘sister’ Jamie Lynn on Instagram.</p><p>Brit starting 2022 right.<br>–<br>Britney Spears por fin ha dejado de seguir a su ‘hermana’ Jamie Lynn en instagram.</p><p>Brit empezando el 2022 bien. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/m2BnpXr5qe</a></p><p>— starlets_royalty (@StarletsRoyalty) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">January 2, 2022</a></p><p>Britney Spears was invited to speak to the House of Representatives of the United States Congress last week to discuss her conservatorship legal battle, with two members requesting she talk about her “empowering” experiences and the “emotional and financial turmoil” she faced throughout the conservatorship process.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2K1orCMmmSdoZabtqTBy61kraGdmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blackpool-stephen-dobbie-manager-relegation.html><span>←</span><span>Blackpool set to appoint Stephen Dobbie as full-time manager despite club's devastating relegation</span></a>
