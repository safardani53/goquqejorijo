Additionally, the outlet reports that Richardson claimed that her client is struggling financially because he is in heavy credit card debt and an apartment that he and Jules purchased to rent out is currently vacant.</p><p><span>Though Jules was not granted the amount she asked for in spousal and child support, Katz ordered that Michael, a principal at Private Capital Group, give the Modern Alkeme founder $10,000 a month.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p>While the pair did not speak and avoided eye contact at all costs during their court hearing, they will continue to live under the same roof. Katz said that Michael will live on the first floor (with second-floor office access) of the once-in-love duo’s downtown triplex, while Jules and their children will occupy the top two stories.</p><p><span>“Both parties will remain in their respective spaces and with no infringement,” the judge said. “Both of you need to keep a respectful distance, especially for the children’s sake. It would not serve them well if there is visible tension between you.”</span></p><p>As previously reported, Jules — <a href=#>who will not be returning to <i>RHONY</i> next season</a> —and Michael <a href=#>decided to call it quits on their eight-year marriage</a> after the reality-TV newbie learned of her husband’s alleged indiscretions with another woman.&nbsp;</p><p><span>According to Michael’s former attorney Mark Jay Heller, </span><a href=#>Jules once allegedly physically assaulted her husband</a><span> back in 2012. “In the winter of 2012, Julianne brutally and viciously assaulted her diminutive but brave husband,” he exclusively claimed to </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span> on June 17.</span></p><p>However, a rep for Jules told <i>Us</i> at the time that “this is not the truth, and the truth will prevail.”</p><p><span>Back in June, her costar </span><b></b><a href=#><b>Ramona Singer</b> told <i>Us </i>how the mom of two was affected by the demise of her relationship</a><span>. “I know she’s heartbroken, and I think it’s really sad,” the </span><i>Life on the Ramona Coaster </i><span>author, 59, said. “I mean, listen, let’s face it: Half the marriages [on <i>Real Housewive</i>s] do end in divorce, and they end in divorce for a lot of assorted reasons.”</span></p><p>Ian Drew and Justin Ravitz dish on all the latest during <i></i><a href=#><i>Us Weekly</i>‘s Facebook Live News Update</a>.
