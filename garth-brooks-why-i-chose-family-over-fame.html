Not to mention Brooks is up for what could likely be his seventh <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>entertainer of the year award</a> at the Academy of Country Music Awards on April 19 (fans can vote <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>here</a>).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This is not work,” he tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story of his return to music. “I just love to see people having a good time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet Brooks, 53, insists <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>all the celebration</a> simply pales in comparison to the years he spent away from the spotlight, raising his three daughters, Taylor, 22, August, 20, and Allie, 18, from his first marriage, to Sandy Mahl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“People said, ‘How could you walk away from music?’ ” he says. “But being a dad – there’s nothing that can touch that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not that the adjustment was always easy. After he and Mahl divorced and his mom Colleen died of cancer in 1999, Brooks settled in with his daughters in a one-bathroom bunkhouse on his ranch in Oklahoma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At first, “I’d just stare at them,” he says. “I knew their sweet faces and their dispositions. But I didn’t know who they were.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The singer’s solution was to mix discipline with fun, and he flourished as his days were filled with packing school lunches (complete with handwritten notes), chores on the ranch and after-school activities from soccer games to school plays.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“You start being a part of the community,” he says. “The dads across the soccer field looked at me as a dad just like them. And I was very grateful.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The time also taught him valuable lessons as a father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kids, he says, “are the greatest joy and the greatest heartache you’ll ever have. The saying is, as long as your babies are healthy, everything else you can deal with. If they have D’s, if they flunk, you deal with it. You can introduce them to the Lord, teach them manners, teach them to believe in themselves, but the truth is, they’re going to be who they’re going to be.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brooks admits his return to music full time has helped him face an otherwise troubling empty nest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that all three girls have graduated high school, “I am in the period now where I think I pray more than I ever have in my life,” he adds. “Because for some reason when they were under my roof, I felt like I might have had some control, you know?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Touring with “Miss Yearwood,” as he affectionately calls her, has made all the difference.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Thank God I’m with the love of my life,” he says. “That’s why I know I’m right where I’m supposed to be.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more of Brooks’s exclusive interview – and to see his personal family photos – pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Okwq%2FA0bJmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXay1unnIZpqhp6OaeqetzKKjsmWfq7KzecWapJ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vo7wf73vqyggjcgo6xfla0wrdob-p443.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Gunsmoke Season 19 Episode 7: The Widow and The Rogue</span></a>
