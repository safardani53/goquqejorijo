I would be lying if [I said] I haven’t thought about it. And then I have to check myself if that’s right for my recovery, and I’m in a very specific situation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RHOCs-Gina-Weighs-Herself-on-Camera.jpg><p>Real Housewives of New Jersey’s<a href=#><strong> Dolores Catania</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Margaret Josephs</a>,</strong> meanwhile, have opened up about their recent weight loss, with the latter <a href=#>taking GLP-1 agonist injections to drop 22 pounds.</a></p><p>“I’m 126 pounds now, give or take a pound depending on the day — and I haven’t been that weight since I got married the first time in 1994,” Josephs told People in April. “My swelling has gone down in my arm. My skin’s gotten tighter. My bones stronger. I’m sleeping better, I have more energy. Not to get into the dirty details, but I’m very good sexually, thanks to the hormones. And I’m back to a weight that feels natural for me. So, it’s all been very positive for me. I feel great; more than anything, I feel great.”</p><p>Catania, for her part, <a href=#>is on Mounjaro,</a> which she told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> is “another part” of the Ozempic umbrella.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to come to the reunion looking any bigger than anyone else, so I got on the bandwagon,” she said on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. “[I’m] just not hungry [on it].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Their castmate <a href=#><strong>Jackie Goldschneider</strong></a>, who was a “friend” on season 13, which is currently airing, seemingly isn’t a fan of their strategies as she slammed Ozempic in February.</p><p>“It gets me so fired up. … I’m horrified by it. I’m not so much horrified by people wanting to lose weight — that has always been a universal thing — but I’m very, very scared of what will happen if and when people have to go off this drug,” Goldschneider, who has been open about her own battle with an eating disorder, said on Page Six‘s “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast. “From a selfish standpoint, I wanted to come back into a world where everyone around me was eating and loving food and enjoying life. I wanted to come back to that and I didn’t because a lot of people in the Housewives world are on Ozempic. A lot of my friends are in the Housewives world, so it was tough for me to come back and suddenly no one’s eating when we go out to dinner.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaroJ%2BYwG6zyKeYZqOZp8CktMSnn56hpJq%2Fbr7Er5yapKNitaa%2BjLCcop%2BYqXqiucidZKiylaK9qq%2BMq6ymp6KofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jersey-shore-jenni-jwoww-farley-engaged-to-zack-clayton-carpinello.html><span>←</span><span>Jersey Shore's Jenni 'JWoww' Farley Engaged to Zack Clayton Carpinello</span></a>
