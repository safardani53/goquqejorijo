She has six of them.</p><p>Kim had her eldest daughter, Brielle, at a young age. Brielle is now an adult, and they have an interesting relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>So interesting, in fact, that she prompted Brielle to flash her bare breast over social media. And, as you’ll see in the video below,&nbsp;Brielle totally went for it.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg></p><p>For a little context:</p><p>Kim Kardashian’s father rose to fame in the ’90s during the O.J. Simpson trial. Kim was also basically Paris Hilton’s sidekick in the early 2000s.</p><p>But how did Kim herself rise to fame?</p><p>Well … it was mostly her infamous sex tape.</p><p>There are many who argue that Keeping Up With The Kardashians would have been a footnote in reality television history if Kim hadn’t become so well known through her sex tape, which had been recorded years earlier.</p><p>Many have said that Kim Zolciak wants to be the next Kris Jenner. As a reality star with six children, she’s well on her way.</p><p>But is she trying to push Brielle to follow in Kim’s footsteps?</p><p>Most moms don’t push their daughters to flash the camera, let alone broadcast that video to the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>And some fans are saying that Kim Zolciak is "pimping out" Brielle.</p><p>This isn’t the first time that Kim has been slammed for allegedly sexualizing her daughter</p><p><a href=#>Kim Zolciak offered up Brielle’s oral services</a> in a tweet o Chrissy Teigen&nbsp;looking for John Legend tickets.</p><p>Was it a joke? Obviously.</p><p>Was it in good taste? No.</p><p>And Kim Zolciak’s parenting in general has been called into question when she <a href=#>kept the dog who had attacked her young son</a>.</p><p>(Though that, at least, seems to have been the right choice)</p><p>This video, though, is really something else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In the video (and be warned, there’s some language in it … but again, we’re talking about a video that also features a boob), Kim Zolciak is speaking to someone.</p><p>It is widely believed that she’s talking to <a href=#>Khloe Kardashian, who is pregnant</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the now-deleted Snapchat video, Kim Zolciak speaks about how she’d have disliked having a sister (with context, it may mean that she’d have hated having a pregnant sister while she herself was pregnant; Khloe has two sisters who are expecting).</p><p>Then she prompts Brielle to flash her breast to the woman — who might be Khloe — saying that Brielle’s boobs represent the sort of bust that a pregnant woman can look forward to.</p><p>Brielle protests that the woman to whom Kim is speaking has felt her boobs before.</p><p>But Kim insists and Brielle flashes her left boob to the camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Maybe the controversial video was posted by accident, maybe it wasn’t.</p><p>Some believe that Kim Zolciak may have posted and then deleted the video in an effort to obtain fame with it while retaining plausible deniability. She could always pull the "I’m in my 30s! I don’t know how Snapchat works!" card.</p><p>Regardless, the video ends with some tasteless lines about feeling sorry for men accused of sexual harassment.</p><p>It’s weird to hear people sympathize with those accused of wrongdoing instead of with people who were victims of mistreatment. Maybe the Zolciak-Biermann household is just in a bubble?</p><p>Anyway, here’s the video, in all of its glory:</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8o77InqOlnV2Xtqa%2BzJqlp2WSlr%2Bmv4yhnKtlkqS8o3nArWSkoZ1ix7C4wqKYpKtdnru0tdKtnKeblWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-ed-speleers-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Ed Speleers Dating Now</span></a>
