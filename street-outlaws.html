If a racer wants to move up the list, they have to challenge someone who is ranked and win. Out-of-state racers — from Texas to Kansas City to California — can challenge racers on the list for money and bragging rights as well.</p><h2>Are Street Outlaws raced fixed?</h2><p>While Street Outlaws is based on illegal street racing, the races themselves are legal — but that doesn't mean the <a href=#>race is fixed or staged.</a></p><p>"The show itself wasn't actually illegal," <a href=#>Screen Rant</a> explains in a cohesive breakdown. "Every race was cleared and permitted by the city the crew happened to be visiting that episode." So while it might appear like the racers are engaging in illicit activities, "the crew would put in for a permit, which would be either denied or approved by local officials."</p><p>The source continued, "To keep things extra safe and legal, local police officers would often drop by to keep an eye on the races and the roads were always shut down for the racers' private use."</p><h2>Who won Street Outlaws: Fastest in America?</h2><p>Eight teams faced off in Memphis for the title of <a href=#>"Fastest in America"</a> (and $100,000) — and the final showdown was between MSO and NOLA. JJ Da Boss and the Memphis team was crowned the winner outside of Las Vegas in 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKxfqMGzscStZKitpKGuuL8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jack-curry-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Jack Curry Dating Now</span></a>
