I knew I did well. I heard from the directors that I was their top choice but the studio kind of had someone else in mind: <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Taylor Thomas</strong></a>,&nbsp;actually,&nbsp;from&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Home Improvement</a>.</i>&nbsp;They wanted to see that through because he was a [well-known] name.”</p><p class=p1>Biggs added at the time:&nbsp;“I never talked to JTT before or after, but I am incredibly grateful because I think he passed. I think he actually had the offer if I’m correct. … Theoretically, he could have done it but at the time, I think it didn’t fit with his more family-oriented brand.”</p><p class=p1>Taylor Thomas — who <a href=#>played one of<strong> Tim Allen</strong>’s sons on&nbsp;<i>Home Improvement</i></a>, a family-friendly sitcom that wrapped in 1998 — ultimately <a href=#>turned down the role of Jim</a>, allowing producers to take a chance on the&nbsp;<i>Orange Is the New Black&nbsp;</i>alum.</p><p class=p1><i>American Pie&nbsp;</i>— directed by <strong>Paul Weitz</strong> and written by <strong>Adam Herz</strong> — also starred <a href=#><strong>Chris Klein</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Thomas Ian Nicholas</strong></a>, <strong>Eddie Kaye Thomas</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Seann William Scott</strong> </a>to round out Jim’s group of East Great Falls High friends. <a href=#><strong>Eugene Levy</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Coolidge</strong></a> also <a href=#>had scene-stealing roles</a> as Jim’s dad and Stifler’s mom, respectively.</p><p class=p1>“The Weitz brothers kept me going,” Coolidge later gushed <a href=#>during her Golden Globes acceptance speech</a> in&nbsp;January 2023 when <a href=#>she won Best Supporting Actress in a Limited/Anthology Series</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The White Lotus</i></a>, referring to the movie’s director&nbsp;Paul Weitz&nbsp;and producer&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Chris Weitz</strong></a>. “I milked [<i>American Pie</i>] to the bone. I mean, I’m still going for six or seven [movies], whatever they want, you know?”</p><p class=p1>The raunchy comedy, <a href=#>which debuted in the late ’90s</a>, took its name from Jim’s infamous sexual experiment with a pie — a scene that Biggs is <a href=#>wary about sharing with his two sons</a>. (The&nbsp;<i>Outmatched&nbsp;</i>alum and wife <a href=#><strong>Jenny Mollen</strong></a> welcomed <a href=#>Sid and Lazlo</a> in 2014 and 2017, respectively.)</p><p class=p1>“We both kind of struggle with [how to explain the movie to them],” Biggs said during a February 2023 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Live With Kelly and Ryan</i></a>. “It’s coming — pun intended — we don’t want to be premature in telling them. We don’t want to give them the information too soon, they’re still pretty young, but we don’t want them to hear it from their friends either.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>My Best Friend’s Girl&nbsp;</i>star confessed at the time that <a href=#>his boys were aware of the film’s title</a> and that “there is a pie” involved but they still remained in the dark about the more NSFW plot lines.</p><p class=p1>“We were flipping [channels] once, and&nbsp;<i>American Pie</i>&nbsp;was on, and I stopped on to for a minute because <a href=#>it was a scene that [Sid] could watch</a>,” Biggs previously told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in March 2019. “He<a href=#> was shocked at how I looked</a> because I was 20, so I looked like a child. I was a child, so he was just kind of captivated by that. Then I knew that there was, like, a crazy scene coming up, so I had to change it.”</p><p class=p1><i>American Pie&nbsp;</i>ultimately <a href=#>spawned three sequel films</a>: 2001’s&nbsp;<i>American Pie 2</i>, 2003’s&nbsp;<i>American Wedding&nbsp;</i>and 2012’s&nbsp;<i><a href=#>American Reunion</a>.&nbsp;</i>While the cast, <a href=#>who all returned for the spinoffs</a>, has since gone their separate ways professionally, they <a href=#>are still down for another flick</a> in the popular franchise.</p><p class=p1>“That’s been sitting on a shelf at Universal collecting dust. There’s been a script for five years.<a href=#>&nbsp;<strong>Jon [Hurwitz]</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Hayden [Schlossberg]</strong>, who wrote and directed&nbsp;<a href=#><i>American Reunion</i></a>, wrote it,” Nicholas, who played Kevin Myers, <a href=#>exclusively told<i>&nbsp;Us</i>&nbsp;in February 2018</a>. “Universal hired them to write it. I thought we were doing it the following year. That was the plan and then I didn’t hear anything.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “Hopefully, Disney doesn’t buy Universal and we get to make&nbsp;<i>American Pie 5</i>. I think there’s a chance. There’s always a chance. We <a href=#>never thought we were going to do</a> the fourth one.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to check in with the&nbsp;<i>American Pie&nbsp;</i>stars more than two decades later:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BWuqa%2ByJyYp2WgnrJur8Csq2avmJq%2FpnnAq5xmrJiaxm66zrBko5mjpLtursignqxlkaOxbrnOq5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-transformers-actress-isabela-moner-dating-after-break-up-with-jace-norman-details.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Transformers Actress Isabela Moner Dating After Break up With Jace Norman?
