She’s asked me some questions a lot of people are afraid to ask.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e5BxZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2fsrO%2FxLJkrKCfp7JutsCcomaZnqm8r7vFn2SwnZSZtq%2BzjK%2BgnZ2fZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./father-runs-over-kids-video-games-with-a-lawn-mower.html><span>←</span><span>Father Runs Over Kid's Video Games with a Lawn Mower</span></a>
