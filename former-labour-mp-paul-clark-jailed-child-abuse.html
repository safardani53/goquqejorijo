I kept telling myself to stop."</p><p>During his time as a <a href=#>Labour</a> MP, he was a parliamentary private secretary for high-profile Cabinet members including deputy prime minister <a href=#>John Prescott</a> and education secretary <a href=#>Ed Balls</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On Courts">Read More On Courts</h2><p>Clark, who at a previous hearing gave an address in <a href=#>Wallington</a> in Surrey, pleaded guilty last December to three offences of making indecent photos of children between April 2013 and May 2021.</p><p>The father-of-two also admitted six charges of distribution between October 2020 and May 2021.</p><p>Prosecutor Daniel Stevenson told the court none of Clark's offences took place while he was an MP.</p><p>But Mr Stevenson said there were two "distinct periods of offending" - with 20 images downloaded in 2013 and the majority seven years later during the <a href=#>Covid-19</a> <a href=#>pandemic</a> <a href=#>lockdown</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>A total of 298 category A images, 415 category B and 733 category C were found on two iPhones, an HP laptop, a hard drive and Acer computer tower.</p><p>The age range of the children being abused ranged from three to 16, Mr Stevenson told the court.</p><p>The iPhones contained what Mr Stevenson called "two significant chatlogs" in which Clark discussed the sexual abuse of children in <a href=#>WhatsApp</a> and <a href=#>Kik</a> conversations with two other users identified as "Toni" and "PR".</p><p>The court was also told of the sexual terms used in Clark's internet searches.</p><p>Ronnie Manek, defending Clark, told the court the ex-MP's life took a "downward spiral" during lockdown and led to his further offending.</p><p>Mr Manek said: "Covid hit and played a huge factor. It was a time when the country was in lockdown, and I appreciate it's no justification, but it can affect the mindset of individuals."</p><p>Jailing Clark for 28 months, Judge Philip Statman told him the case represented "a tragic fall for someone who had put the community first" - but the offences were so serious, jail was inevitable.</p><p>The judge added: "Each of these children is a victim. From the images it is clear they are disturbed by that which is being done to them.</p><p>"This is a catalogue of criminal offending, committed for your own sexual gratification.</p><p>"It is not just a case of browsing on the internet. This is almost a level of addictive conduct which you pursued and you have a very long way to go in understanding what led you to commit these criminal offences.</p><p>"Much has been rightly said about the public service you have performed in the past.</p><p>"You put the community first and indeed you have tried your best to continue with issues of a community nature, not just here but in Africa since you lost your seat in 2010.</p><p>"It is right too that I emphasise there is no suggestion that any of your offending took place during the time when you were a sitting MP.</p><p>"But there is punishment that comes your way on a very different level - the ignominy and public humiliation that your appearance in the dock in the crown court causes you."</p><p>The judge said he accepted that the pandemic and his failing marriage may have contributed to his mild depression.</p><p>He told Clark: "Possibly because of the job you had, the control you had, the excitement you had in those years both as an MP and after, travelling as you did - that being at home and stuck with difficulties within your marriage may have contributed to the level of depression that you felt.</p><p>"I have no doubt as you sit there engaged in this offending, it doesn't go through your mind that you will be caught and be presented before a crown court today."</p><p>But Mr Statman insisted he could not spare Clark jail, as his barrister had urged.</p><p>The judge said: "These offences clearly pass the custody threshhold and well and truly pass the level which would permit me to impose a suspended sentence order, bearing in mind the aggravating factors I have mentioned."</p><p>Clark will have to serve half his sentence and will be subject to signing on the sex offender register for 10 years on release.</p><p>He will also be subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order and barred from working with vulnerable adults and children.</p><p>Clark was supported in court by two relatives, said to be his cousins.</p><p>The Labour stalwart was said to have played a key part in the 2005 general election, hosting then-prime minister <a href=#>Tony Blair</a> and chancellor <a href=#>Gordon Brown</a> on a visit to Kent.</p><p>Clark was later appointed transport minister in 2008.</p><p>After losing his seat two years later, Clarke stood for re-election in 2015 but was again defeated by Conservative Rehman Chisti.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>After leaving the Commons he set up a PR and business management consultancy firm, Gateway Associates.</p><p>In 2018, he spoke out about alleged sexual harassment at <a href=#>Westminster</a>, calling for "thorough investigations" and disciplinary processes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ390f5dpbHBnlqS%2FrrHRZqOamp%2Bqv265z2anmq2cYrCtrdGkZKOZmaGypXnCoaClnF2Wr7a%2FxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erkan-petekkaya.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Erkan Petekkaya net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
