The theme parks' executive chefs crafted these culinary creations inspired by The Haunting of Hill House, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Bride of Frankenstein, and so many other iconic horror imagery relative to the attraction that your group's biggest scaredy-cat will have something to enjoy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/VK3kDH-gI/0x0/pumpkin-cocoa-bomb-1630032209449.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"This year’s selection of more than 20 mouthwatering items is so unique, they are as much a 'must-do' as the slate of haunted houses, scare zones, and shows," Universal said in a statement.</p><p>There are four menu items inspired by The Haunting of Hill House with a Stuffed Brisket Grilled Cheese and a Jalapeño Bacon Grilled Cheese, as well as a vegan Tempeh Reuben and Sauerkraut for meatless munchers. Wash it down with the Poison Tea Party, a rum punch with an iced tea lemonade base.</p><p>Carnivores will love the Roasted Lamb Spit and Severed Ribs inspired by Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, while those with a sweet tooth can enjoy the savory/sweet combos inspired by Jack the Clown. The Jack’d Donut Slider is a beef patty between two bourbon glazed donuts, while those looking for their just desserts might prefer Dr. Pinetti’s Confetti Battered Oreos or Tiny’s Twinkies.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>There are also three menu items inspired by The Bride of Frankenstein, including soft-serve ice cream and the Flammkuchen flatbread or Reibekuchen potato pancake.</p><p>There will also be dishes inspired by the Wicked Growth: Realm of the Pumpkin original haunted house (with a vegan option!) and the Revenge of the Tooth Fairy original haunted house.
