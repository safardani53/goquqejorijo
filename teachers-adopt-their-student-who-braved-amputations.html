"He finds a way to do whatever he puts his mind to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nate remained optimistic even when he was hospitalized in September 2019 for emergency surgery to prevent an infection in his arm. To comfort the boy who always brightened her reading class, Jenna decided to go visit him in the hospital.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was there by himself with no family," she recalls. "I wanted to cheer him up and have someone he knew there with him."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jenna, Nate and Tim Riccio.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Jenna Riccio</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the hospital, Jenna learned that Nate had been removed from his family's home just 10 days earlier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Nate's doctors were worried about him missing appointments and not getting the medical care he needed," says Jenna.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Upon discharge, Nate was to be sent to a foster home more than an hour away from the school that had become his happy place.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It wasn't the ideal situation for him," says Jenna. "I worried about what was going to happen to him."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jenna realized she had plenty of space for Nate at her home, which is near his school, so she casually asked a Department of Children and Families caseworker if she could become his foster parent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For more on Nate's journey, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday, or subscribe </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When she headed to her car to leave, she immediately called another DCF caseworker to further inquire about becoming Nate's foster parent. Then she called Tim, who was her boyfriend at the time. His surprise quickly turned to excitement at the prospect of parenting the boy whose infectious charm always made him smile.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wanted to be a part of it," says Tim.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Jenna underwent background checks and home visits to get approved as a foster parent, Nate went home from the hospital with Jenna on Oct. 3, 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Within weeks, it felt like we were a family," Tim says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Three months later, on New Year's Eve, Tim proposed. Nate served as the ring bearer at the couple's wedding on May 15, 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The love in the room was amazing," Jackie Vidal, Nate's social worker, tells PEOPLE. "People had to get in line to dance with Nate."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nate and Julien Riccio.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Jenna Riccio</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last February, Nate became a big brother when Jenna gave birth to her and Tim's daughter, Julien.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's obsessed with him," says Jenna, "and lights up when she hears his voice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Nate was already part of their family, it wasn't until Nov. 18 that he officially became Jenna and Tim's son.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This day is amazing!" Nate exclaimed at Waterbury juvenile court at his adoption hearing, which happened on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>National Adoption Day</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was so happy," he tells PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After 1,142 days in foster care, the courtroom was packed with Nate's social workers and even the Connecticut Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This boy just really affects people in such a positive way — he just exudes positive, joyous energy," says Vidal, who is no longer a social worker but is now lovingly considered Nate's "Aunt Jackie."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nate's biological brother Giovhany Mondestin, 22, with whom the Riccios remain close, was also there for support.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>“We have the best family ever,” says Nate Riccio (with Tim and Jenna and his older brother Giovhany Mondestin at his adoption hearing in November).</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Jenna Riccio</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We always tell Nate, 'I know you learned how to be a good big brother from your big brother,' " says Jenna.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By all accounts, the boy — now in the 5th grade — is thriving.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They take care of me in every way, the best way possible — the way that my parents weren't able to," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once a wheelchair user, Nate now walks on prosthetic legs. He'll need more surgeries on his amputations as his bones grow through his skin, but his sickle cell crises — including gastrointestinal issues and a compromised liver — "have gotten so much better," says Jenna.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These days, when he's not playing with his little sister, Nate can be found at an acting workshop, pursuing a passion that he hopes will someday land him on the big screen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Mich.
